The road down to the Sunrise Mine trailhead was a bit rough in places, with at least a single large washout that I was impressed our large van could handle - the clearance was better that I thought! Our hike down the trailhead started around 8:30ish, after a quick banana/peanut butter breakfast.\nThe hike in was really pretty, with 3-4 stream/river crossings and some amazing mountain views as the trees thinned. Pardon the mediocre image quality : ).\nMatthew on the trail\nEventually the trail turned into a treeless alpine meadow\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and then into a talus field. The transition was marked by this cute campsite:\nKovas trying to find which switchback is the last one, so we could break off. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you still have a ways to go.\nA short ways up we saw this ice cave, reminiscent of the Big Four Ice caves we visited the previous day:\nOn the talus, the trail became hard to follow, and we lost it on our way up. We knew we had to leave the trail at some point, but were not sure which direction. On the Mountain Project guide there were directions to break off before the last set of switchbacks. But because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a map, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know when the last set were. Luckily we eventually found this trail marker, which marked our fork left, with the pass trail going right. This whole process led to a lot of confusion on the approach, and likely added 30 minutes to it.\nA view from much higher up that shows the switchback clearly.\nAfter finding our turn off, it still embarrassingly took us a bit to disambiguate which of the peaks we were actually planning to climb\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but we found it eventually!\nAs we closed in on the peak the Mountain Project description for how to approach got a lot clearer, as did the pass tail with its many switchbacks.\nThis reddish colored rock with a slight trickle of water marked the end of our hike and the start of our climb. We stopped here briefly for our last banana+bread wraps, left our bag on a ledge, and continued up! Our climb started at around noon; we lost some time on the approach pathfinding.\nThe climb up was very easy to track both by scanning for the bright, new bolts and referencing the Mountain Project description. The first pitch had a very obvious start, with three close bolts through a slightly overhanging juggy start. It was a bit intimidating as a first lead, but quickly confidence boosting as I realized the moves were actually quite natural.\nLooking down from the first belay.\nThe second pitch was more relaxed, and the third, long, pitch had a couple sections of hiking-with-a-rope. The views were beautiful the whole way.\nMatthew starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nKovas starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nThe summit!?\nLooking back at the switchbacked pass trail from a better vantage.\nWe reached the summit at around 4pm (behind schedule), but were treated with an amazing view anyway : ).\nLooking over into the next valley. The snow reminded me of the lava flows in the Lord of the Rings films. I wonder if they shot those scenes by just recoloring snow?\nOfficial! Funnily enough some of our friends from the UW IMA had just summited a week before.\nRappelling down was met with some trickiness at first; our first rope through went a bit off route and we needed to find our way back kinda awkwardly. The next couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3.\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel. I remember having to daisy-chain some quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the anchors. Instead I had to stop at this tree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and belay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors. This is where we ran into another snag:\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\nImage source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel. Unfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much easier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through. This is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch. Our knot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling and pulling would set it free!\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach. I was able to grab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the whole climb back to the anchors. I noticed a clear spot where the knot had gotten stuck. I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the climb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have been very stuck. I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and pulled the rope with no issues.\nThis extra \u0026ldquo;climb\u0026rdquo; burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a hasty descent. We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started scrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully) setting.\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking almost into a jog as the trail got flatter. On the way down, we passed a very tired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip. Their calming influence was very welcome.\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights, as it was now completely dark. We managed to do this part of the trail in record time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing. Luckily we were both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the other side of the river without too much more time.\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to our campsite just after they closed at 10pm. The gatekeeper took pity on us and let us in without a fine or any other trouble. Our fellow campers were pretty worried about us though. Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip made me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite communication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a great sport -\u0026gt; alpine climbing introduction. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go so far as to call it \u0026ldquo;pleasure climbing\u0026rdquo; like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie called it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience. Just make sure you give yourself enough time!\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/climbing/event-reports/first-512/','title':"First 512",'content':" My First 5.12!

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently perfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many times. This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not important, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such steps. So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my attempt at a Manifesto style checklist. As in the book, I tried to make this checklist as useful and evidence driven as possible. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make it short enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to injuries/death.\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most commonly cause injuries when climbing. According to The edidemiology of mountaineering and rock climbing accidents, in Grand Teton National Park from 1981 to 1986 these were:\n Bad fall, usually on lead (34 cases). Rock fall when climbing (11 cases). Getting lost off route (6 cases). Rappelling off the rope end (1 case). Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases). Not using proper protection (7 cases). Not using a rope (4 cases)! Not wearing a helmet (3 cases).  Most of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on show/ice, which I\u0026rsquo;m ignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!), which is in line with most of the anecdotes in The Checklist Manifesto.\nAnother study, \u0026ldquo;Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado Canyon State Park\u0026rdquo;, has similar statistics. This study references a similar Australian study with more interesting results.\nHere is the current checklist:\nBEFORE CLIMBING: - Ensure harnesses are on correctly. - Ensure belay device is locked and through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope is tied through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope has stopper knot at non-climber end. - Determine if any extended slings will be needed to avoid rope running over rock. - Discuss rock fall hazard and what to do if it happens. BEFORE RAPPELLING: - Ensure both ends of rope have stopper knots. - Weight rope while still using personal anchors.

Therefore, I generally keep my screen at a low brightness level.\nOn Linux I use Redshift to keep my screen at a low temperature (low 3000Ks). Currently I use a constant temperature all the time, as opposed to making the color lower at night.\nOn Windows I use f.lux with default settings (changing color over the day). I frequently mess with the color temperature slider based on what I am doing.\nSelective Window Brightness On Linux I prefer dark, lower contrast color schemes for coding or working on the command line. They feel easier on my eyes and allow for more variety of color for use in (for example) syntax highlighting. I find that colors blend into light backgrounds more, and are therefore less readable.\nHowever, most documents in the world are rendered with black text on a white background. I find this perfectly readable, but starkly different from my dark color schemes. This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I often do when I\u0026rsquo;m writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my web browser.\nTo fix this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a couple things:\n Using a page dimmer in my web browser.  This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not strictly on the page.  Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally.  Works for all light colored programs! The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme. This definitly makes the terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out util they all become white (#ffffff). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boost brightness enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct.   The current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different programs using Compton. This is not a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found here. The patched code can be found here. To configure this method, you can add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in the root of that repository. I run it by adding this to my ~/.xinitrc:\n~/.xinitrc --- compton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:'class_g=\u0026quot;Google-chrome\u0026quot;' --backend glx -b  Another idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter pixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged. I read that using the HSV color encoding could provide a good way to define what \u0026ldquo;brighter\u0026rdquo; means and a way to change it. Luckily, Compton provided a easy way to mess with this! My fiddling can be found in the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a function like this to map the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher V values are \u0026ldquo;dimmed\u0026rdquo; more than lower ones).\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like this one. When changing the shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the change made in the shader! For example, after setting the shader to map V values above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those values turn black.\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows globally, as opposed to dimming certain colors. But it was fun to mess with and I may return to it in the future!\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models, such as CIELAB or YCbCr.\nOn Windows Because I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer than the primary to not distract from the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing, but still be there to look stuff up. I use the exellent Pangolin Screen Brightness utility to do this.\n"});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/docs/divinity-os2-build-idea/','title':"Divinity Os2 Build Idea",'content':"Skills: - Adrenaline (1 scoundrel) - Battering Ram (1 warfare) - Battle Stomp (1 warfare) - Crippling Blow (1 warfare) - Enrage (2 warfare) - Phoenix Dive (2 warfare) - Whirlwind (2 warfare) - Challenge (3 warfare) maybe - Tentacle lash (1 polymorph) - Heart of Steel (1 polymorph) - Smoke Cover (1 aero, 1 scoundrel) - Teleportation (2 aero) - Nether Swap (2 aero) - Uncanny Evasion (2 aero)\nPut points into abilities enough to learn skills, then the rest into 2-handed\n"});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/docs/eating/cooking/','title':"Cooking",'content':" Staples Oats  1 cup rolled oats 2 cups water  Boil water, add oats, cook for 5 mins on stovetop.

Based on the information in the book, it seemed like fasting provided some easily attainable health benefits, if making it a habit wasn\u0026rsquo;t too disruptive to my life. My first experiment happened shortly after reading the book. I attempted a DIY-Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) as described in the book for 5 days.\nI used eatthismuch to pre-plan my meals for the FMD. I think it would have been much harder for me to adhere to the diet if I did not do this. Here is what I ate:\nIf my memory serves me well, I remember feeling quite good during my fast, which some minor headaches on day 2-3. I did this during my vacation from work, and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember working intensely on any particular project during this time, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u0026ldquo;stress test\u0026rdquo; of the diet.\nWater Only Fast - December 2020 Further exposure to fasting proponents, especially Peter Attia (via e.g. his podcast with Eileen White, made me think about the simpler prospect of doing a water only fast. I finally attempted this during a work week in December 2020. My schedule looked like:\n Tuesday:  Large Spinach, Tomato, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Italian Seasoning Salad for lunch Some walnuts for dinner  Wednesday:  Only water  Thursday:  4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate (in water) + steak seasoning  Friday:  4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate + potassium containing spice mix   Here are the stock ingredients I used:\nI felt surprisingly normal during my fast. Especially when exercising - I went on my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3 sets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually better than I normally do. Perhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of the fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -\u0026gt; 185lbs).\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never too seriously. This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was fasting.\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm in my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping. The Wed-Thurs night I did not sleep very well because of this. Any kind of draft under the blankets was very noticeable and interrupted my sleep. I wearing light sweatpants and a shirt the next night helped a lot (usually I sleep close to naked). On the whole, I would say my sleep was worse during the fast than normal.\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute force on them. For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start tingling. And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle strongly. Apparently, this is expected. This was reduced when I starting drinking broth.\nOne thing that I also definitely noticed during my fast was a shift in my brain activity. I felt much more \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; than usual - I had a consistant motivation to be busy in one way or another. However, I also felt a bit more impatient. If a task I was busy doing started to stall, I would eagerly try to shift to another task, or even multitask. This was good for getting lots done, but not as helpful for cracking a difficult problem (e.g. debugging a computer program) I could use this feature of fasting in the future if I need to be particularly productive in this way.\n"});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/docs/eating/food/','title':"Food",'content':" Food Goals  Delay chronic diseases as long as possible. Described well in this talk by Peter Attia. The big (linked!) ones are:  Cardiovascular disease. Cancer. Neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome.  Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding:  Periods of low motivation. \u0026ldquo;Food coma-ing\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Snack train-ing\u0026rdquo;, or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more.   What should I eat and when? The most convincing diet structure I\u0026rsquo;ve found has been The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo. This diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping protein intake low.\nThere are a couple of amendments I\u0026rsquo;ve made based on my personal experience (in service of goal 2 above). These include:\n Not eating breakfast. I find myself most productive in a fasted state (even a prolonged fast, and eating breakfast breaks be right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time.\n This is counter to Longo\u0026rsquo;s suggestions, some other research on circadian rhythms by Sachin Panda, and the American Heart Association. The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with yet), and don\u0026rsquo;t seem too strong to me. This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which is widely recommended:  Sachin Panda   Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day. These foods uniquely mess with my energy levels. I\u0026rsquo;m eager to get some Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this.\n  Other tenants I try to live by: 1. Eating whole foods as much as possible.\nMy Current Food Strategy First Meal: ~11:30am  Leafy greens (cabbage, kale, collard greens, salad mix, spinach). Extra virgin olive oil (a lot of it). Onions, carrots, garlic, celery, bell pepper Avocado Walnuts, pecans, almonds Nutritional yeast Salt/spices/vinegar/soy sauce/etc.  This usually manifests as a large salad or stir fry.\nSecond Meal: ~6 to 8pm I try to exercise in some way daily when I have a lull in my energy levels or focus in the afternoon. Then I shower and eat around an hour later.\n Peanut butter More leafy greens Oatmeal Potatoes Oily fish (sardines, salmon) More nuts More olive oil or coconut oil Popcorn  This food is uniquely good at starting a \u0026ldquo;snack train\u0026rdquo; for some reason.  Beans (chickpeas, pinto, etc.)  Eating too many destroys my energy level unfortunately : (.   Things I try to avoid  Eggs Dairy Meat Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods)  Danger of Fast Carbs  Sugars/Syrups  In practice I may have small amounts (\u0026lt;1 \u0026ldquo;serving\u0026rdquo;) of these things about once a week.\nNote also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons (avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food industry is not easy for me to support.\nFasting One of the big takeaways I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten from my readings so far is that spending a good amount of time in a \u0026ldquo;fasted\u0026rdquo; or food deprived state is good for many reasons. I therefore try to eat when I\u0026rsquo;m hungry (not bored) within a shorter period of the day. I\u0026rsquo;ve also had good success with prolonged fasting.\nGood Resources on Diet In Defense of Food by Michael Pollan I highly recommend this book! The biggest takeaway I got from it is that our tendency to break down foods and biology in general into atomic nutrients/aspects and pretend that is all they are (for easier study) leads often to bad models of reality. Biological systems are highly interwoven and the impact of stuff on them often depends on the greater context. For example, our body\u0026rsquo;s ability to absorb certain nutrients depends on what those nutrients are dissolved/complexed within.\nHow Not to Die by Michael Gregor This book is a good survey of diet from the \u0026ldquo;Whole Food Plant Based\u0026rdquo; perspective. Sometimes I think the author gets a bit over-zealous about how his philosophy is the best and makes lazy, broad, strong statements that are not adequately supported. For instance, dismissing certain foods (like meat) as obviously unhealthy without examining the counterpoints.\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s web site nutritionfacts.org is a decent source of information, though it suffers from the same problems as the book.\nGenius Foods by Max Lugavere This book takes a more brain focused approach to diet, which pushes it more into the keto- space. AFAIK, ketogenic diets are more linked to brain health than other diets. I think it falls into the same trap as Michael Gregor, but not quite as badly. It\u0026rsquo;s a good intro to lots of cool food/health topics to explore more independently.\n"});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/docs/game-ideas/general-theory/','title':"General Theory",'content':" Game Types/Mechanics/Appeals Engine Building When a player continually updates a state (e.g. a farm or rpg character or desk) with new elements, with each step making the state better at acheiving some goal.

This includes: - Building walls - Deploying units as archers/warriors - Digging moats - Making traps - Building farms or other buildings that do not help defend, but accumulate resources for next round.\nCombat Phase After setup, the base is attacked by a wave of enemies. At this point, the player has no control, and just gets to watch their design work (or not). This automatic combat is done is waves, where the entire enemy team moves/attacks at once, then the entire friendly team moves/attacks at once.\nGoal of the Game Survive X number of waves. Perhaps the more waves you survive the more interesting the game gets (or there are multiple endings).\nProgression When starting the game, you can choose from multiple \u0026ldquo;biomes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;campaigns\u0026rdquo; that play out in a predictable way.

Therefore, feeling stressed or guilty about not being able to continue focusing on a task is counterproductive - use of willpower to keep focused is a patch solution that many times actually depletes even more mental energy. A better solution is to move to another location and take a break by zoning out or otherwise doing nothing. Switching tasks I find sometimes also can help with this - perhaps different types of tasks exercise different mental energy reserves.\nThe Pomodoro method uses the idea of \u0026ldquo;sprints\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bursts\u0026rdquo; of mental effort, followed by short breaks, usually in a 25m on, 5m off cadence. In my experience, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth interrupting a flow state with 25m timers - using this as a guideline generally works better for me.\nOne way to look at this issue is that as you do something hard (requiring learning), your mind contracts/focuses on the problem until it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected event (or new solution idea) is hard to handle. This is counter to an \u0026ldquo;expanded\u0026rdquo; mind where many possibilities are open and easy to handle. If you have been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do something you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion. Going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens this process. So going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no listening to anything, no conversations with people) is a great technique. Some of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of \u0026ldquo;How to Change Your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan.\nIt could be also that the learning mind simply tires over time and needs a break.\nDistraction and Friction Working in the presence of distractions or other environmental factors that make work require more effort can actually boost productivity to a certain extent. I find that more difficult or \u0026ldquo;stressful\u0026rdquo; problems can more fully engage me, leading to a personal response than more than compensates for the increased difficulty. Listening to energetic music, or working with others around are good examples of this. Standing desks might also have a similar effect. People who watch TV/videos/streams when working may also be tapping into this effect.\nSee the book \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo; for more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\nFood Personally, eating - especially being full - can derail my ability to be in a productive, flow state. Given this, I try to adhere to this eating schedule to minimize the time I spend full when I want to be productive:\n Meal 1: After waking up and completing one work \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo;. Meal 2: After finishing work and completing one personal \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo;.  For both cases, I should delay the meal as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t feel hungry, and even delay a bit if I do feel hungry, to take advantage of the productivity boost that comes when anticipating food (see \u0026ldquo;Distraction and Friction\u0026rdquo;).\nMy first meal should mostly be fatty/with complex carbs. Eating a high-refined-carb (bread/sugar) meal will likely start a \u0026ldquo;snack train\u0026rdquo; that will make it very hard to focus.\nMotivation See https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/docs/how-to-build-skills/','title':"How to Build Skills",'content':"Look at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24696658 for an example of writing practice.\nAdvice for artistic practice: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtt1ycq2rVI\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/docs/how-to-finance/','title':"How to Finance",'content':" Financial Strategy Stock options  Excellent Reference  Retirement Finance To look at  Option writing as income strategy  "});index.add({'id':23,'href':'/docs/how-to-write/','title':"How to Write",'content':" How to Write Writers Block Try talking to someone (or yourself) about your topic, recording the conversation, then using speech-to-text technology to fill your blank page with a first draft.\nhttps://vasilishynkarenka.com/8questions/\n"});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/docs/hydroponics/journal/','title':"Journal",'content':" Hydroponics Journal 12/30/2020 Assembled grow system and planted two net pots with kale/lettuce seeds.

In a culture that values education, it would also be something valued/recognized a little more by everyone. The larger problem with leaders isn\u0026rsquo;t really effort imo, it\u0026rsquo;s integrity. Plenty of leaders are working very hard and putting in plenty of effort, just not towards the people\u0026rsquo;s interests, because there is some other incentive they care more about (?/influence/fame/power, idea spreaders want to get paid or be famous, politicians need favor with the right groups to be successful, etc.). On the systemic side, our systems need to incentivize integrity, because they don\u0026rsquo;t currently. On the people side, our culture could recognize and incentivize integrity more if the people recognize and value it more\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Many idea spreaders put in loads of effort, they are incredibly hard workers. But they\u0026rsquo;re not working to inform, they\u0026rsquo;re grifters\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how rigorous our experts are if culturally we don\u0026rsquo;t trust them and are more trusting of the grifters (and the grifted). Or if our leaders actively undermine them.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes true. I was assuming policy makers are not putting enough effort behind the task of rigorously deciding what \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; have rigorous evidence for their ideas, and that is why idea spreaders can work their ideas into implementation. Like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, policy makers also have their own biases that further disrupt their ability to pick the right idea. My thought is that if we can make it very clear/consequential when a wrong idea is implemented, maybe we can incentivize the selection of better ideas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that scientists/experts should be held to high standards of rigor, but policy makers should be able to do the job of reviewing scientific work and ensuring that is in fact well done before running with it\u0026rdquo;\nOr they could just trust it if there is a very clear widespread consensus among the scientists who actually know how to review that work\n\u0026ldquo;I think getting people to listen to the experts at all comes first.

My proposed mechanism for how to do that in this conversation is to give decision makers more ownership/accountability/responsibility over their decisions, so that there are actual repercussions to not listening to experts.

If we set up the metrics poorly and put too much trust in them we run the risk of creating new gameable systems for people to exploit. Decisions may also be good for the long term but have short term costs, and decisions can have far-reaching effects which impact the metrics/data of future decisions and leaders. This is the kind of approach most corporations try to take and a common issue is that it becomes too focused on the short term, potentially at the expense of the long term. Whatever metrics we use should be chosen carefully, and the metrics will likely need to be changed/improved over time. And there are lots of things that will still need to be examined qualitatively, without a clear metric\n\u0026ldquo;\nYeah this stuff is messy : /\n\u0026ldquo;I think some of the biggest things that need changing are in infrastructure.

Still, there are clear problems with clear solutions there, a lot kf which relate to teasing out these bad incentives I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about and improving the strength and health of our democracy and checks and balances. Imo that is some of the most critical stuff that needs fixing, and it\u0026rsquo;s in the way of fixing so many other more direct/tangible things\u0026rdquo;\nYep. One thing I hope for in the future is that more people will be able to spend their time doing this stuff as our economy gets better at satisfying our basic needs.\n\u0026ldquo;I also agree that a more informed public has intangible impact and isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s another feature of the health/stability of our country. If we fixed all of our systems and made them much better but the public was still very uninformed, things could still devolve over time. I think structures (systems and policies) and culture (people, public opinion, values, opinions, education) are linked and it can be either a vicious spiral or a virtuous one\u0026rdquo;\nIt takes a lot of effort to find and champion the issues you\u0026rsquo;re talking about\nYep\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad we have this is text, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to summarize this weekend and post as an essay/blog post\u0026rdquo;\nAt least for my own future reference\n\u0026ldquo;And the culture ones not tangible, it isn\u0026rsquo;t really even an issue we can fight for, it\u0026rsquo;s the rippling effect of all of our interactions and experiences\u0026rdquo;\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s ok with you\nYeah that lack of direct actionability bothers me : /\nYeah go for it\n\u0026ldquo;The thing you said about time is part of the argument tor things like UBI. The thing is, no matter how efficient our economy gets at producing, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily give the people time if there is artificial scarcity. As in, there is enough food/housing/whatever to go around but people don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it unless they work ridiculous hours (and maybe not even then). This is a really large topic, but it\u0026rsquo;s part of why people like to hate on capitalism recently. There are a lot of ways artificial scarcity is created for the sake of greed/profit, and if ? is what you care about, creating/maintaining artificial scarcity is actually what people with a lot of ? are incentivized to do in the current system\u0026rdquo;\n👍\n\u0026ldquo;If things \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;trickled down\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;, all the efficiency would benefit the people, but there is nothing in the system to make that so. It might sometimes in certain ways or might not. At the end of the day, the people with the money have the power for it to trickle or not and the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them\u0026rdquo;\nYeah we live in a very wierd society in that way. I guess at least it allows for interesting people like elon musk to exist\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting really tired of powerful people being so \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; haha\u0026rdquo;\n out at your place during the day, if nothing else just for a change of scenery )\u0026rdquo;   your place during the day, if nothing else just for a change of scenery )\u0026rdquo;  I\u0026rsquo;m free/down :)\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find a break in the rain around midday if that\u0026rsquo;s cool\u0026rdquo;\nHari says he\u0026rsquo;s busy at 7\nOk np\nBut he\u0026rsquo;s free the rest of the day\n👍\nOn way\n👍\nBtw we birding up now\n\u0026ldquo;Another point about socialism: whenever a well-regarded historical figure supports socialism or other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;radical\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; ideas (not actually radical but things we tend to strawman as radical), we tend to filter that out whenever we teach/celebrate that person\u0026rsquo;s achievements. E.g. MLK was a democratic socialist, so was bertrand russell. But also apparently there\u0026rsquo;s more technicalities to the definitions of different kinds of socialism which I don\u0026rsquo;t totally understand, like social democrat and democratic socialist are 2 different kinds of socialism that are both not the scary communism kind. There might be other kinds that have been tried before, idk\u0026rdquo;\nThat historical whitewashing doesn\u0026rsquo;t just apply to people but also historical examples of successful democratic socialist governments\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m reading the last book MLK wrote and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing so far. He touches on some of what we talked about wrt anger and emotion. He points out that rage can replace reason if we let it but also says people need to rise up with indignation to demand necessary reforms be instituted. So blind reasonless rage is bad, but properly directed, rational moral indignation is good. Not just good but necessary for the right change to occur. Sending snaps of the actual quotes\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rocklike intransigence\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (people become entrenched and won\u0026rsquo;t change their minds) and \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (e.g. propaganda and maliciously strategic actions like voter suppression, gerrymandering, undermining or circumventing democracy) captures the major ways progress is difficult even when you have a good solution which could fix or vastly improve a problem if implemented. Maintaining a large complex system that works for the people is already difficult work (like it is in software engineering) but these other forces add a whole new level of difficulty, which comes from antagonistic humans abusing their power and platforms. That part of the struggle is not a systems design problem, it is more like a battle. These bad actors (think of them as black hat hackers) are very driven, and it will take a lot of collective drive from the public to get change through despite their efforts (preferably more from reasonable indignation than reasonless rage. But the less productive rage will always be there unless the problem improves)\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is a pattern throughout history where if a tension like this exists and worsens over time, the anger and frustration becomes more intense and widespread until it leads to revolution (a violent and chaotic one if rage wins out)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can break down the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; by manipulation of people and culture (propaganda) or systemic manipulation (the other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;maliciously strategic\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stuff I mentioned). A lot of propaganda serves to diffuse reasonable/justified indignation so change is less likely to occur (downplay the severity or validity of the problem), or redirect it to something else (twisting things away from the source of the problem to the wrong cause, or even another completely fake issue). But if problems persist, some kind of rage always remains, however it is processed/directed\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Problems in infrastructure are more abstract and less clearly/directly tied to the problems people get emotional about. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because of that lack of emotional drive that it\u0026rsquo;s especially hard to get changes through in those areas. This is also part of why I think the perspective of math is important, not just because it allows us to see things in a clear and objective way (as clear/objective as humanly possible), but it also gets us thinking about abstract ideas and structure. Better math education means the public is more comfortable doing that\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok I\u0026rsquo;m done spamming you with walls of text for now, sorry\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting! And yeah I think rage/passion is necessary sometimes to keep people behind a cause. Im maybe in denial about it\u0026rsquo;s usefulness\n\u0026ldquo;More generally, imo the harm of emotion comes down to \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reacting before thinking/reasoning\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;. But reacting AFTER thinking things through (and also being open to the idea that you might be wrong and being willing to rethink) is perfectly rational. Furthermore, sometimes strong emotions indicate a person is MORE aware of reality, not the other way around. If you notice your house is on fire and your emotional state is exactly the same as if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t on fire, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that makes you \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet come to terms with the fact that your house is on fire.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah I agree. I will say that from a completely naive observers perspective, the fact that someone is strongly emotional is not necessarily correlated to their viewpoint being accurate. And since emotions often demand strong reaction (e.g. support), a completely naive observer may be savvy to avoid the situation to avoid backing the wrong perspective (e.g. propaganda). Of course, this only applied for naive observers who haven\u0026rsquo;t seen all perspectives and don\u0026rsquo;t have enough info.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In any discussion, ideas exist separately from people and can be examined on their own merit, regardless of the perceived emotional state of the person presenting them or any other details not relevant to what is/isn\u0026rsquo;t true or valid. What this comes down to is rhetoric vs epistemology, \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;winning the debate\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; vs getting at the truth/validity of the ideas themselves. The former isn\u0026rsquo;t rational, it\u0026rsquo;s just what\u0026rsquo;s effective. The latter is how we can actually try to be rational, and we can try to take that approach as much as possible in a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; way to learn as much as possible from any discussion, isolating/evaluating all points made by all sides independently.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric is still an important tool, and it can be used virtuously or viciously. Virtuous rhetoric might simplify things or illustrate things in imperfect ways but minimize the gap between that and reality (and often uses careful wording to draw attention to the oversimplification or caveats of a point), vicious rhetoric maximizes the gap ruthlessly to win the debate at all costs, only simulating virtuosity where necessary as a further rhetorical strategy\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really, savvy observers know the difference between rhetoric and valid logic/methodology and can see through vicious rhetoric. Education makes vicious rhetoric less effective and virtuous rhetoric more effective\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not just education, but also emotional intelligence and wisdom, to know your own biases and common poor shortcuts, and learn how to change or correct for them. Or even just knowing when they\u0026rsquo;re there in a big way, and having a healthy dose of doubt/skepticism as a result\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If your level of certainty is much higher than your level of knowledge/understanding of a particular area, it\u0026rsquo;s a sure sign of some bad shortcuts. It could be a wrong belief that\u0026rsquo;s held onto strongly and forced into any lens we look through, it could be we think of certain ideas as completely interchangeable when they\u0026rsquo;re not (but may still be related in a weaker way), it could be a type of confident and charismatic speaking really appeals to us, speech that is unemotional in tone, etc.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For me this is one of the most productive aspects of thinking about these things - you learn a lot about yourself and other people along the way, in ways that can\u0026rsquo;t be planned or forseen. If you decide to take some kind of action, you\u0026rsquo;ll do so in a less half-baked way. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t do anything with a direct outsized impact, this process of honest examination, careful thought and introspection can have rippling positive effects on the world and yourself\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was talking with Claire some more about this and it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more clear to me (partially based on her observations of me) that I am currently uncomfortable with ethos and pathos based arguments because I see them as shortcuts to an end goal that can hide problems. This feeling has persisted strongly in me probably because I haven\u0026rsquo;t faced challenges where those shortcuts are necessary to succeed. You are right that real rhetoric is necessary to accomplish societal goals; I think I personally just haven\u0026rsquo;t faced many/any of them so I don\u0026rsquo;t see it\u0026rsquo;s true value. As you can already maybe see from our conversations, I (currently) take a more passive approach to these issues in an attempt to understand them deeply (mistrusting shortcuts), maybe idealistically thinking that I even can do that. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this would win me much success in changing hearts/minds or even doing anything at all besides avoiding or running from the problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that virtuous rhetoric is very useful, and distrusting ALL rhetoric makes learning anything really hard. I think some people selectively take the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reject all rhetoric\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stance to avoid inconvenient truths\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026rdquo;(but they have to believe some rhetoric, like I do)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I deeply distrust rhetoric and shortcuts and I think it\u0026rsquo;s healthy. I am not advocating for taking more shortcuts internally, but rather for awareness of the shortcuts that exist and a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; to prune/refine them and not put certainty in them or hold onto them so tightly. This is why I also prefer cooperative discussion to competitive debate. In the former, rhetoric is not necessarily needed (or if it is needed it\u0026rsquo;s not relied on as heavily) and both parties benefit from understanding each other fully without appeals or posturing, and it can also be a more honest/open conversation, without fear of showing something which could be perceived as weakness (expressing emotion, admitting to not knowing certain things, admitting to mistakes in thinking, being wrong, etc.). Openness requires that all parties in the discussion can see past the rhetorical shortcuts and are invested in understanding the best version of what each person has to say (steel-manning), while allowing cooperative corrections/refinement of the ideas for everyone\u0026rsquo;s benefit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m also advocating for understanding rhetoric, how it fools other people and how we fool ourselves. We are not logical emotionless robots no matter how hard we try to be, and trying to view ourselves in that way tends to decrease our self awareness, hurting our ability to see our biases/shortcuts clearly. The shortcuts/biases are still there but we lose our greatest tool for finding them and push them further out of our conscious thoughts, making them more likely to deepen than to diminish. If we do this emotional suppression and also convince ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re being rational, we run the risk of becoming overly certain and confident in ourselves while being less aware of the weakness of our own thinking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric becomes important when speaking to people who we aren\u0026rsquo;t sure we can have that kind of nice, healthy discussion I described with or when we speak with any kind of platform. I think the distrust of emotional people thing you were describing IS a rhetorical shortcut based on ethos. Full logos would take what is said and consider it for its own merit, based on logic and whatever other evidence/methodology is being used, treating things like emotional tone as just noise, not relevant to the ideas (this is how an emotionless robot would interpret what is said).\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you were to eliminate all shortcuts and maintain perfect awareness of your assumptions, you\u0026rsquo;d be doing math (or what math aspires to be, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee mathematicians don\u0026rsquo;t also make mistakes, but at least everything stated so clearly and unambiguously that the mistakes are not so hidden). Everything past that is progressively less solid and more uncertain, which is fine as long as you have some awareness and flexibility.\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And yeah, people move the goalposts all the time for how rigorous/logical arguments need to be to be convincing and hold inconsistent standards for evaluating truth (as high as possible for opponents and as low as possible for themselves). People are suddenly very skeptical and great at finding flaws when looking at something they don\u0026rsquo;t want to believe.\u0026rdquo;\nSorry for writing another essay :p\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great, I\u0026rsquo;M sorry I haven\u0026rsquo;t been responding as elequently : P. Good point about the emotional -\u0026gt; less trust bridge being ethos based. That\u0026rsquo;s a good perspective; and it makes it easier for me to see that my correlation there is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reasonable\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIssues with Reasoning\nTo improve our condition in the world, one of the best tools we humans have is \u0026ldquo;distributed reasoning\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll define this as the ability of people to build useful models of the world in their heads based on models of the world communicated to them by other people. Through this process, new people, or people new to an area of knowledge can shortcut the learning process, enabling novel stuff to happen.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that the majority of communication that enabled distributed reasoning is rhetorical in nature; that is, it involves an asymmetric exchange between a teacher trying to persuade a student of something. I use the word \u0026ldquo;persuade\u0026rdquo; because it captures the changing of mind that is required when learning something new - or unlearning something.\nBecause our minds have limited memory, attention span, and processing power, teachers must provide incomplete arguments in their lessons. It is impossible in most cases to provide an airtight explanation for why what the teacher is saying is right. To keep arguments persuasive, teachers often fall back on assumptions, appeals to authority (e.g. \u0026ldquo;what this expert says is the gold truth\u0026rdquo;), appeals to common sense (e.g. \u0026ldquo;this is obvious\u0026rdquo;), or appeals to emotion (e.g. statistics presented in a scary way).\nAlthough this may seem problematic, it\u0026rsquo;s actually necessary to employ these techniques because, practically, people need to learn and have limited resources with which to do so. An alternative, pure epistemology is usually too slow in most contexts. For those who need to make real decisions now, going down epistemologic rabbit holes is a good recipe for failure.\nIn most cases, this system works extremely well. People learn skills quickly with it and, if the teacher\u0026rsquo;s lesson was misleading, they get fast feedback when what they are trying to do fails. This is very clear in trade-like contexts, like programming or building stuff. Hard science education also uses this system well. Most models of the world taught to students in science classes have serious problems with them, but are still useful stepping stones on the path to either further understanding or useful application.\nA bit of a breakdown occurs when the decisions people make based on rhetorical arguments have unclear or delayed consequences. Here is where being more epistemological becomes very useful. However, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes even unclear when decisions even have unclear results! For example, a clear cause-effect relationship with a subtle, hard-to-notice additional effect. These relationships are everywhere in complex systems like human societies.\nOver history our ability to execute rhetorical communication has only improved due to the written word and other media. In the last generation the ability of any person to participate both as a teacher and a student has been scaled up to a global level.\nThis intensification of our ability to distributed-ly reason, coupled with the unclear cause-effect relationships found in the complex systems we are reasoning about leads us to some unpleasant problems. Chief among these is the rampant application of very focused rhetorical arguments to societal problems. Anyone can throw down an argument with holes or that doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider the full picture and gain a following, since people are historically very used to absorbing such arguments. Since societal problems are so complex, thinking epistemological-ly more often than not leads to dead ends or unless findings, which further discourages eager activists from taking that route.\nSo, as a result, we find ourselves in a sticky situation. The complexity of our world has become daunting, but the average quality of our solutions to its problems are low. Therefore, the effort required to dig through and find a good solution is increasing.\nUnfortunately, the personal incentives/consequences for doing/not doing this work don\u0026rsquo;t always seem to be aligned with its importance. One great example is economic policy - punishment for failures is pretty low1. It is too easy for thought leaders to recommend arguments for implementation without consequences when those arguments lead to problems. This is especially problematic when those thought leaders have incentives other than those of the people they are serving.\n See writings of Nicholas Taleb [return]   "});index.add({'id':35,'href':'/docs/society-and-economics/','title':"Society and Economics",'content':" Interesting Talks/Articles  Downsides of Meritocracy  Excessive work justifying class is harmful for everyone, particularly the wealthy.
