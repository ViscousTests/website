The road down to the Sunrise Mine trailhead was a bit rough in places, with at least a single large washout that I was impressed our large van could handle - the clearance was better that I thought! Our hike down the trailhead started around 8:30ish, after a quick banana/peanut butter breakfast.\nThe hike in was really pretty, with 3-4 stream/river crossings and some amazing mountain views as the trees thinned. Pardon the mediocre image quality : ).\nMatthew on the trail\nEventually the trail turned into a treeless alpine meadow\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and then into a talus field. The transition was marked by this cute campsite:\nKovas trying to find which switchback is the last one, so we could break off. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you still have a ways to go.\nA short ways up we saw this ice cave, reminiscent of the Big Four Ice caves we visited the previous day:\nOn the talus, the trail became hard to follow, and we lost it on our way up. We knew we had to leave the trail at some point, but were not sure which direction. On the Mountain Project guide there were directions to break off before the last set of switchbacks. But because we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a map, we didn\u0026rsquo;t know when the last set were. Luckily we eventually found this trail marker, which marked our fork left, with the pass trail going right. This whole process led to a lot of confusion on the approach, and likely added 30 minutes to it.\nA view from much higher up that shows the switchback clearly.\nAfter finding our turn off, it still embarrassingly took us a bit to disambiguate which of the peaks we were actually planning to climb\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but we found it eventually!\nAs we closed in on the peak the Mountain Project description for how to approach got a lot clearer, as did the pass tail with its many switchbacks.\nThis reddish colored rock with a slight trickle of water marked the end of our hike and the start of our climb. We stopped here briefly for our last banana+bread wraps, left our bag on a ledge, and continued up! Our climb started at around noon; we lost some time on the approach pathfinding.\nThe climb up was very easy to track both by scanning for the bright, new bolts and referencing the Mountain Project description. The first pitch had a very obvious start, with three close bolts through a slightly overhanging juggy start. It was a bit intimidating as a first lead, but quickly confidence boosting as I realized the moves were actually quite natural.\nLooking down from the first belay.\nThe second pitch was more relaxed, and the third, long, pitch had a couple sections of hiking-with-a-rope. The views were beautiful the whole way.\nMatthew starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nKovas starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nThe summit!?\nLooking back at the switchbacked pass trail from a better vantage.\nWe reached the summit at around 4pm (behind schedule), but were treated with an amazing view anyway : ).\nLooking over into the next valley. The snow reminded me of the lava flows in the Lord of the Rings films. I wonder if they shot those scenes by just recoloring snow?\nOfficial! Funnily enough some of our friends from the UW IMA had just summited a week before.\nRappelling down was met with some trickiness at first; our first rope through went a bit off route and we needed to find our way back kinda awkwardly. The next couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3.\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel. I remember having to daisy-chain some quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the anchors. Instead I had to stop at this tree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and belay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors. This is where we ran into another snag:\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\nImage source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel. Unfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much easier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through. This is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch. Our knot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling and pulling would set it free!\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach. I was able to grab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the whole climb back to the anchors. I noticed a clear spot where the knot had gotten stuck. I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the climb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have been very stuck. I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and pulled the rope with no issues.\nThis extra \u0026ldquo;climb\u0026rdquo; burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a hasty descent. We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started scrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully) setting.\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking almost into a jog as the trail got flatter. On the way down, we passed a very tired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip. Their calming influence was very welcome.\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights, as it was now completely dark. We managed to do this part of the trail in record time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing. Luckily we were both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the other side of the river without too much more time.\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to our campsite just after they closed at 10pm. The gatekeeper took pity on us and let us in without a fine or any other trouble. Our fellow campers were pretty worried about us though. Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip made me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite communication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a great sport -\u0026gt; alpine climbing introduction. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go so far as to call it \u0026ldquo;pleasure climbing\u0026rdquo; like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie called it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience.

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently perfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many times. This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not important, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such steps. So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my attempt at a Manifesto style checklist. As in the book, I tried to make this checklist as useful and evidence driven as possible. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make it short enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to injuries/death.\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most commonly cause injuries when climbing. According to The edidemiology of mountaineering and rock climbing accidents, in Grand Teton National Park from 1981 to 1986 these were:\n Bad fall, usually on lead (34 cases). Rock fall when climbing (11 cases). Getting lost off route (6 cases). Rappelling off the rope end (1 case). Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases). Not using proper protection (7 cases). Not using a rope (4 cases)! Not wearing a helmet (3 cases).  Most of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on show/ice, which I\u0026rsquo;m ignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!), which is in line with most of the anecdotes in The Checklist Manifesto.\nAnother study, \u0026ldquo;Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado Canyon State Park\u0026rdquo;, has similar statistics. This study references a similar Australian study with more interesting results.\nHere is the current checklist:\nBEFORE CLIMBING: - Ensure harnesses are on correctly. - Ensure belay device is locked and through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope is tied through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope has stopper knot at non-climber end. - Determine if any extended slings will be needed to avoid rope running over rock. - Discuss rock fall hazard and what to do if it happens. BEFORE RAPPELLING: - Ensure both ends of rope have stopper knots. - Weight rope while still using personal anchors.

This includes: - Building walls - Deploying units as archers/warriors - Digging moats - Making traps - Building farms or other buildings that do not help defend, but accumulate resources for next round.\nBuildings/units would be purchased from a store like Autochess/Underlords, with many options and synergies. If you purchase multiple units of the same kind from the store, they combine just like in Underlords. The store system in SNKRX is great inspiration here.\nCombat Phase After setup, the base is attacked by a wave of enemies. At this point, the player has no control, and just gets to watch their design work (or not) in real time (like TABS).\nTurn Based Combat Option The automatic combat is done is waves, where the entire enemy team moves/attacks at once, then the entire friendly team moves/attacks at once.\nGoal of the Game Survive X number of waves. Perhaps the more waves you survive the more interesting the game gets (or there are multiple endings).\nProgression When starting the game, you can choose from multiple \u0026ldquo;biomes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;campaigns\u0026rdquo; that play out in a predictable way. I want the player to feel like they are learning with every defeat, just like in every time loop in Outer Wilds.

I\u0026rsquo;m writing them here so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget them, and so others might learn something - or point out flaws in my reasoning so I can get better!\nInformation, and Proactivity Most FPS fights come down to proactively acting on information about where exactly your opponent is. If you know with precision where your opponent is, and they don\u0026rsquo;t know where you are, you can confidently peek at them and often even prefire (or shoot as you are peeking). Even if your aim is worse, you will most of the time win the fight because your opponent has to reactively (1) notice you, (2) readjust their aim (often \u0026gt;90 degrees of turning), and then (3) shoot - whereas you get to skip the first two steps.\nAdditionally, if you are peeking off of an information advantage, you also have the benefit of controlling the timing of the fight. Since you are peeking around cover, you can always easily reverse your peek and duck back behind cover if needed to reload or retreat. This gives yet another massive advantage to you.\nUsually, proactively peeking someone involves you moving, but it can sometimes involve you staying still in an unexpected place and using audio cues to anticipate an enemy coming into view. Here, even though you are not moving, you are still the proactive party - your opponent is reacting to you. Of course, for this to work, you must be sure your opponent doesn\u0026rsquo;t know where you are, otherwise they will peek you and almost certainly win since they control the timing of the fight.\nGetting and Keeping an Information Advantage To win as many fights as possible, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to take those fights with an information advantage. But how do you get this advantage and keep it as much as possible?\nThe Cone of Danger The most useful way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this is to always hold in your head a model of where your opponents might be. One way to think about this is a \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo;. Imagine you can see through the walls of the map you are playing on. Then draw a cone from the leftmost enemy all the way to the rightmost enemy. This is the \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo; you need to expect you opponents to be in. Practically, since you normally cannot see through walls, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to constantly estimate this, drawing the cone from corners enemies could peek out at you from.\nIdeally, you want to keep this code as small as possible:\nwhile making your opponent\u0026rsquo;s cone as large as possible:\nThe best way to do this is by making it possible for yourself to move around your opponent freely without them seeing you, while making it so any movement they make is detectable by you. This generally involves controlling (knowing for certain no enemies are in) most of the map.\nPractically, moving around a lot also helps mess with your opponents cone. Even if you have the ability to move around your opponent freely, your opponent will often make the assumption you stayed still - if they are right, then they have a very small cone when they go to peek you. A good practice is to always move after an enemy sees you if possible.\nDifferent games provide different tools to help determine where opponents are. Use these!\nPeeking Unknown Corners If you are peeking around a corner into an unknown area with many potential enemy locations, it\u0026rsquo;s best to jiggle peak back and forth around the corner checking each individual location one-by-one. This will help make sure you are not fighting multiple enemies at once, and will give you control over fight timing. Be careful that this can be difficult when close to a corner, since every unit of movement you make will expose a lot more of you than if you were further from the corner.\nInfluences  Great break down by CoachNihil of kandyrew\u0026rsquo;s gameplay which helped inspire the \u0026ldquo;cone of danger\u0026rdquo; thinking.

Fire Emblem 7 \u0026amp; 8 I first played this game on the Game Boy Advance when I was in middle school. For some reason the art style and especially animation really spoke to me, and I found the gameplay loop very compelling. Fair warning though that this game may be on this list mostly because of nostalgia.\nOne aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building your party over time and making sure you train the right characters. It\u0026rsquo;s very satisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience with the goal of making them a core part of your team composition later on. This is often fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which only adds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.\nAnother cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters. When two characters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, which leads to little dialogue bites. It\u0026rsquo;s satisfying to discover these as you play through the game.\nBoth training weaker units and building supports are examples of \u0026ldquo;meta-challenges\u0026rdquo; in FE; they aren\u0026rsquo;t required to finish the games, but give you self-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles. Because these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I am expressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interesting than if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.\n2.

Especially when exercising - I went on my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3 sets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually better than I normally do. Perhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of the fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -\u0026gt; 185lbs).\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never too seriously. This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was fasting.\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm in my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping. The Wed-Thurs night I did not sleep very well because of this. Any kind of draft under the blankets was very noticeable and interrupted my sleep. I wearing light sweatpants and a shirt the next night helped a lot (usually I sleep close to naked). On the whole, I would say my sleep was worse during the fast than normal.\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute force on them. For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start tingling. And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle strongly. Apparently, this is expected. This was reduced when I starting drinking broth.\nOne thing that I also definitely noticed during my fast was a shift in my brain activity. I felt much more \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; than usual - I had a consistant motivation to be busy in one way or another. However, I also felt a bit more impatient. If a task I was busy doing started to stall, I would eagerly try to shift to another task, or even multitask. This was good for getting lots done, but not as helpful for cracking a difficult problem (e.g. debugging a computer program) I could use this feature of fasting in the future if I need to be particularly productive in this way.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/docs/health_and_longevity/food/','title':"Food",'content':" Food Goals  Delay chronic diseases as long as possible. Described well in this talk by Peter Attia. The big ones are:  Cardiovascular disease. Cancer. Neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome.  Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding:  Periods of low motivation. \u0026ldquo;Food coma-ing\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Snack train-ing\u0026rdquo;, or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more.   What should I eat and when? The most convincing diet structure I\u0026rsquo;ve found has been The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo. This diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping protein intake low. This podcast has a compelling dissent of Longo\u0026rsquo;s thoughts here; basically it states that Longo\u0026rsquo;s ideas makes sense, but so do many other ideas and we know now that insufficient protein can be unhealthy (I need to dig more into this) - the evidence to lower intake in spite of this is not strong enough yet. Note that personalizing protein intake levels while optimizing longevity seems to be possible by measuring Blood Urea Nitrogen levels as described by Michael Lustgarten.\nCool paper about food group epidemiology: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801.\nThere are a couple of amendments I\u0026rsquo;ve made based on my personal experience (in service of goal 2 above). These include:\n Not eating breakfast. I find myself most productive in a fasted state (even a prolonged fast, and eating breakfast breaks be right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time.\n This is counter to Longo\u0026rsquo;s suggestions, some other research on circadian rhythms by Sachin Panda, and the American Heart Association. The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with yet), and don\u0026rsquo;t seem too strong to me. This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which is widely recommended:  Sachin Panda   Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day. These foods uniquely mess with my energy levels. I\u0026rsquo;m eager to get some Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this.\n  Other tenants I try to live by: 1. Eating whole foods as much as possible.\nMy Current Food Strategy First Meal: ~11:30am  Leafy greens (cabbage, kale, collard greens, salad mix, spinach). Extra virgin olive oil (a lot of it). Onions, carrots, garlic, celery, bell pepper Avocado Walnuts, pecans, almonds Nutritional yeast Salt/spices/vinegar/soy sauce/etc.  This usually manifests as a large salad or stir fry.\nSecond Meal: ~6 to 8pm I try to exercise in some way daily when I have a lull in my energy levels or focus in the afternoon. Then I shower and eat around an hour later.\n Peanut butter More leafy greens Oatmeal Potatoes Oily fish (sardines, salmon) More nuts More olive oil or coconut oil Popcorn  This food is uniquely good at starting a \u0026ldquo;snack train\u0026rdquo; for some reason.  Beans (chickpeas, pinto, etc.)  Eating too many destroys my energy level unfortunately : (.   Things I try to avoid  Dairy Meat Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods)  Danger of Fast Carbs  Sugars/Syrups  In practice I may have small amounts (\u0026lt;1 \u0026ldquo;serving\u0026rdquo;) of these things about once a week.\nNote also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons (avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food industry is not easy for me to support.\nFasting One of the big takeaways I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten from my readings so far is that spending a good amount of time in a \u0026ldquo;fasted\u0026rdquo; or food deprived state is good for many reasons. I therefore try to eat when I\u0026rsquo;m hungry (not bored) within a shorter period of the day. I\u0026rsquo;ve also had good success with prolonged fasting.\nMeasuring Personal Dietary Effects Ideally, I would measure the effects of different foods on my personal health directly so that I know what works for me (as opposed to what should work generally). This takes work unfortunately. Here are some options that I should probably explore at some point:\n Viome microbiome testing Regular blood testing w/Morgan Levine\u0026rsquo;s biological age calculation. See also Aging.ai.  Specific Food Notes Advanced Glycation End Products Created by high heat cooking of especially protein-rich foods (e.g. meat/nuts). But all foods contain. Ideal to reduce the amount of this eaten.\n Michael Lustgarten evidence video Great overview/reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/  It would be cool to measure this in blood. Perhaps a1c inflammation test is a good proxy.\nFlax Seeds It seems like baking flax seeds will not degrade omega-3 content (biased source).\nNutritional Yeast Contains MSG (probably not harmful) and uric acid (probably harmful in large quantity) (source). Also is a fairly processed food.\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/docs/health_and_longevity/influences/','title':"Influences",'content':" Influences These works have guided by thinking about how to maintain good health for as long as possible. They are roughly sorted by their level of influence on my thinking.\n[The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).\nGood examination of fasting, as well as an overview of different ways to think about how to determine which diet is the healthiest long term (Longo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;5 Pillars\u0026rdquo;).\nLifespan by David Sinclair Cool review of a new theory of aging that seems promising to be. Also does some good review of longevity concepts. This was my introduction to the field (specifically a Joe Rogan Experience David Sinclair interview). Be aware that David Sinclair is pretty optimistic and eager to promote things that are not 100% solid yet (see Resveratrol).\nRed Pen Reviews I haven\u0026rsquo;t dug deeply into this website, but my skimming has found that it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good way to determine which books to trust and which not to - a very important task given the plethora of bad nutrition advice out there.\nMichael Lustgarten\u0026rsquo;s Diet Michael Lustgarten is heroically tracking all the food he eats and doing regular blood testing. His diet, although very personalized, may be a good starting point for a generally healthy diet.\nIn Defense of Food by Michael Pollan I highly recommend this book! The biggest takeaway I got from it is that our tendency to break down foods and biology in general into atomic nutrients/aspects and pretend that is all they are (for easier study) leads often to bad models of reality. Biological systems are highly interwoven and the impact of stuff on them often depends on the greater context. For example, our body\u0026rsquo;s ability to absorb certain nutrients depends on what those nutrients are dissolved/complexed within.\nThe Good Gut Great book about microbiome health. Does a good job revealing what we do know about the gut and how frighteningly little that is! Unfortunately, due to how little we know about the gut, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a lot of super actionable advice here, except eating lots of fiber or \u0026ldquo;Microbiota Accessible Carbohydrates\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;MACS\u0026rdquo;) as they\u0026rsquo;re referred to in the book.\nThe Queen of Fats by Susan Allport Really interesting read about the science of omega-3 fatty acids. One of the core thesis is that our western diet has a higher-than-historical ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, which causes problems. This is because the body can use these fats for the same purposes, but they have different performances for those purposes. For example, prostaglandins can be made with omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, but the omega-3 variants are less \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo; and may contribute less to heart disease.\nDoes a really excellent job of telling the story of the scientists who study/studied these fats, instead of just passing down diet rules without context.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid_ratio_in_food has some data about omega-3/omega-6 ratios.\nHow Not to Die by Michael Gregor This book is a good survey of diet from the \u0026ldquo;Whole Food Plant Based\u0026rdquo; perspective. Sometimes I think the author gets a bit over-zealous about how his philosophy is the best and makes lazy, broad, strong statements that are not adequately supported. For instance, dismissing certain foods (like meat) as obviously unhealthy without examining the counterpoints.\nThe author\u0026rsquo;s web site nutritionfacts.org is a decent source of information, though it suffers from the same problems as the book.\nGenius Foods by Max Lugavere This book takes a more brain focused approach to diet, which pushes it more into the keto- space. AFAIK, ketogenic diets are more linked to brain health than other diets. I think it falls into the same trap as Michael Gregor, but not quite as badly. It\u0026rsquo;s a good intro to lots of cool food/health topics to explore more independently.\nBiohack Stack Good place for ideas to experiment with. Good example of an interesting profile: https://biohackstack.com/posts/michael-lustgarten/.\nAging.ai A cool system for quantifying biological age.

Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a lighter sleep phase. I\u0026rsquo;ve found this to be way more pleasant than waking up at a fixed time. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I more naturally wake up by myself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body associates it with lighter sleep.\nThis app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.\nTemperature and Airflow For me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my sleep quality. For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and keeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or otherwise stimulate my skin.\nIn practice, I best accomplish this by:\n Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don\u0026rsquo;t get uncomfortably cold. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise \u0026ldquo;warm-feeling\u0026rdquo; sheets to that my skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to fluctuations in air temperature or movement.

Everyone involved must take their models out of their heads so that others can amend their own models in an effort to reach some kind of consensus. This is hard work and is not always treated as such.\nNot only is it hard work to do this model-sharing, but it can create cognitive dissonance, which causes pain. This can necessitate further model-sharing to resolve, which can balloon a small issue into a massive ordeal. I like this quote from Valarie Kaur:\n\u0026ldquo;Deep listening is an act of surrender. We risk being changed by what we hear.\u0026rdquo;\nTo expect people to readily do this is in my opinion expecting too much. Of course, putting effort into this process is necessary for many types of work; lots of problems arise when someone is not willing to ever do this.\nThis article does a good job of providing a methodology for resolving friction around model-sharing:\nhttps://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-resolve-a-conflict-when-both-sides-are-right-1f375bc82f7f\nComplaining People complain for at least two main reasons:\n They need help with something. Either via:  Direct help (offloading their problem in part to someone else). Advice help (having another person help improve their understanding of their problem, so that they can solve it alone without transferring any responsibility). In \u0026ldquo;How to Change your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan this was described as a \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo; behavior.  They want to share their feelings so that others around them are on the same page about their emotional state. This is helpful e.g. so others around them will not burden them further, unaware of their current burden. This is also helpful for emotional validation reasons - it is useful to know if the thing you are upset about upsets others; if not, perhaps you are missing an easy resolution to your problem.  In \u0026ldquo;How to Change your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan this was described as a \u0026ldquo;being\u0026rdquo; (in the moment) behavior.   It is easy (at least for me) to jump strait to advice help when people complain around me and ignore the fact that the complainer may need one of the other types of resolution described above.\n"});index.add({'id':26,'href':'/docs/how-to-write/','title':"How to Write",'content':" How to Write Writers Block Try talking to someone (or yourself) about your topic, recording the conversation, then using speech-to-text technology to fill your blank page with a first draft.\nhttps://vasilishynkarenka.com/8questions/\n"});index.add({'id':27,'href':'/docs/hydroponics/journal/','title':"Journal",'content':" Hydroponics Journal 12/30/2020 Assembled grow system and planted two net pots with kale/lettuce seeds.

Unfortunately, these greens do not keep well and are somewhat expensive to buy. Therefore, they are at the highest risk (out of all foods I want to eat) of not being eaten simply because they are not around.\nLuckily, leafy greens are some of the easiest plants to grow hydroponically, and hydroponic systems provide one of the easiest ways to grow plants.\nMethod Most leafy greens should take about a month to grow hydroponically. Therefore, if I want to eat two plants a day, I need 60 plant growing stations in my system.

I bike or walk to enable all my habits, and use public transit or rideshare for one-off journeys.\nWeb synergies: - Built-in exercise, with all its benefits. - Saves money/time required to manage car ownership. - Provides time to spend listing to interesting podcasts.\nWeb anti-synergies: - Takes more time than driving that could be put towards other things. - Activities outside of core habits become logistically harder, and sometimes don\u0026rsquo;t happen because of this. For instance climbing outside or going to events.\nClimbing During non-pandemic times, I climb (mostly longer routes with a rope) in a gym 2-3 days a week.

Therefore, I generally keep my screen at a low brightness level.\nOn Linux I use Redshift to keep my screen at a low temperature (low 3000Ks). Currently I use a constant temperature all the time, as opposed to making the color lower at night.\nOn Windows I use f.lux with default settings (changing color over the day). I frequently mess with the color temperature slider based on what I am doing.\nSelective Window Brightness On Linux I prefer dark, lower contrast color schemes for coding or working on the command line. They feel easier on my eyes and allow for more variety of color for use in (for example) syntax highlighting. I find that colors blend into light backgrounds more, and are therefore less readable.\nHowever, most documents in the world are rendered with black text on a white background. I find this perfectly readable, but starkly different from my dark color schemes. This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I often do when I\u0026rsquo;m writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my web browser.\nTo fix this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a couple things:\n Using a page dimmer in my web browser.  This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not strictly on the page.  Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally.  Works for all light colored programs! The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme. This definitly makes the terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out util they all become white (#ffffff). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boost brightness enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct.   The current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different programs using Compton. This is not a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found here. The patched code can be found here. To configure this method, you can add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in the root of that repository. I run it by adding this to my ~/.xinitrc:\n~/.xinitrc --- compton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:'class_g=\u0026quot;Google-chrome\u0026quot;' --backend glx -b  Another idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter pixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged. I read that using the HSV color encoding could provide a good way to define what \u0026ldquo;brighter\u0026rdquo; means and a way to change it. Luckily, Compton provided a easy way to mess with this! My fiddling can be found in the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a function like this to map the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher V values are \u0026ldquo;dimmed\u0026rdquo; more than lower ones).\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like this one. When changing the shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the change made in the shader! For example, after setting the shader to map V values above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those values turn black.\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows globally, as opposed to dimming certain colors. But it was fun to mess with and I may return to it in the future!\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models, such as CIELAB or YCbCr.\nOn Windows Because I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer than the primary to not distract from the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing, but still be there to look stuff up. I use the exellent Pangolin Screen Brightness utility to do this.\n"});index.add({'id':31,'href':'/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/financial-strategy/','title':"Financial Strategy",'content':" Financial Strategy Real Estate and Housing  NYT Buy vs Rent Calculator My house comparison spreadsheet (TODO add when finalized)  Stock options  Excellent Reference  Stocks Tax Loss Harvesting  Basics summarized  The Value Factor Investment returns can theoretically be explained by different factors described here.

This is especially annoying with socks. And it leads to wrinkly cloths.  Even if I did fold the cloths, I find that hanging cloths up is easier physically easier than folding them and putting them away.\nLonger Lasting Cloths Cloths seem to wear out less quickly for me using this technique.

Spending time untangling this web of interactions for oneself is a worthy endeavor that has personally helped me feel more consistently energetic. Also a deeper understanding of these interactions will probably make you live longer!\nVision: Vision is a clear path for how to achieve the goal in question, or at least for how to get closer to achieving said goal. Acquiring vision can be tricky and fickle. For me, it helps to:\n Somewhat aimlessly learn about the area of knowledge the goal is in by reading what other people have written/said about it. Sometimes reading about even completely unrelated topics can spark ideas about the original goal. Plant \u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo; in my head relating to the goal. These usually manifest as questions I\u0026rsquo;m curious to know the answers to, or very rough theories that I can\u0026rsquo;t even put into words for how the goals might be achieved. Sleep on my knowledge to find new connections and/or grow the seeds (see Hammock Driven Development). Do cardiovascular exercise like hiking or running to find new connections and/or help grow the seeds. Not sure how this helps (more blood flow to the brain?), but it usually does for me. Take a long break from the goal and work on another goal. Having multiple in-flight projects at onces makes the natural. Set up my environment and habits so that I am consistently exposed to the goal, making it more likely my thoughts will wander to it and make progress decoding it.  Wisdom Wisdom to me means a relative lack of surprise with the behavior of the world around oneself. By this definition, to become wise is to build an effective model of the world in one\u0026rsquo;s head that can predict what will happen consistently, thus avoiding surprise. Because the world is often unpredictable, wisdom also means not expecting things of the world that cannot be expected. For example, there are many catastrophes that could happen at any moment, causing severe damage to one\u0026rsquo;s life - handling these with grace as opposed to feeling the negative emotions that come with unmet expectations is perhaps wise.\nThis is discussed in a lot more detail by Stoic philosophers. My reading of this work is that the universe behaves logically and the better one understands this universal reason (logos), the more in harmony with the universe one will be.\nWisdom also means recognizing that attaining accurate knowledge is often painstaking work, and therefore to be wise is to be patient with learning and not try to take shortcuts when understanding the truth is important. See What to believe for discussion of this.\nWisdom may be related to a well developed \u0026ldquo;System 1\u0026rdquo; as described in Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.\nIn practice, wisdom naturally leads to well-roundedness:\nWell-Roundedness Being well rounded to me means having a wide range of capabilities. This has several strong benefits:\n It reduces single points of failure in life (e.g. injuries or big life changes leaving one without a purpose/focus). It makes moments where the world is negatively effecting one in a way which they are powerless to stop rarer, since it is more likely one will have the skills necessary to redirect or counter the negative effect. It makes you more socially interesting to a wider range of different people. People find capability in specific areas interesting, so more capability in more areas should make you more interesting to more people. It allows one to notice and act on more opportunities in life, since most require some knowledge in their area to detect and exploit. I think it\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to say that ones ability to discover and make the most of opportunities has massive impact on the trajectory of ones life. It hastens learning of new skills and concepts, which often have similarities to other skills/concepts. The more you have command of, the more likely it is that there will be commonalities between the new skill/concept and one you already know. Also, it can help build abstract mental concepts by consciously identifying these commonalities and storing them as a new abstract concept. It enables formation of novel ideas, which are often just ideas from one discipline applied to another.  One way to describe this value is as an aspiration to being a \u0026ldquo;Renaissance man\u0026rdquo; (See ERE for more discussion of this.\nBecoming more well rounded can be achieved by seeing roadblocks in life as personal opportunities for growth. Energetically owning and tackling these roadblocks will lead to learning the best ways to get around them, improving one\u0026rsquo;s breath of knowledge and making similar issues one might encounter later easier to navigate.\nThe \u0026ldquo;I can do this\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I can learn how to do this\u0026rdquo; sentiment when faced with any issue should lead to an increase in well-roundedness over time.\nSome areas of knowledge to consider personally deeply understanding to become more well rounded + tasks to try:\n Repair/construction of objects you depend on - try fixing your computer/cloths/furniture/bike/car/house. Investing savings - try researching, creating, and executing a personal investment plan yourself. Food production - try growing/cooking your own food.  Empowerment To me, empowerment is about leveraging vigor and wisdom to achieve goals. Empowerment and motivation are near synonyms to me. Good environment and expectations dramatically help keep up motivation/empowerment.\nTODO: Merge this with motivation.\nEnvironment A large chuck of my brain does things in response to environmental stimuli. If I see tasty food, part of my brain will want to eat it. If I am too hot or cold, part of my brain will make a fuss. If I\u0026rsquo;m with other people, part of my brain will want to impress or entertain them.\nBecause of this, crafting an environment that encourages healthy behaviors that help you achieve personal goals is really important. I agree with James Clear that it is foolish to think your conscious mind can muscle its way past all the other parts that manage environmental stimuli to reach its goals.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to get swept up in life and let your behavior be dictated by your environment (e.g. what others around you are doing).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s dangerous to do this since your environment is not a sentient being and therefore does not care about anything, let alone your personal happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth taking a step back and consciously running through whether you agree with your environment\u0026rsquo;s influence or not frequently. Otherwise you might end up less happy/satisfied/fulfilled than you might otherwise be.\nDoing this takes time and energy. Therefore, if you want to live more intentionally, it is important to give yourself that space/energy and not fill it with other things.\nOne common and strong environmental force is momentum. It is easier to continue doing something you are already doing than to switch tasks. This can be used to help complete less pleasurable tasks (finishing homework or a workout), but also can make you continue doing an activity past the point of it\u0026rsquo;s benefit to you. Examples of this for me include: eating after already full, playing a game to the point of frustration, and continuing to browse Reddit or YouTube without feeling inspired about what I find. Stopping and checking yourself in these situations with this idea in mind can help you switch tasks to something that will be a better overall use of time. I have a pet theory that your brain gets specifically tired with particular tasks after a couple hours of doing them, and switching at this point to another task often uses enough different parts of your brain to make you feel very fresh in the new context.\nExpectations For me, the hardest part of executing on goals is getting my entire brain on board to apply effort towards my current goal. The best way I\u0026rsquo;ve found to do this so far is by keeping the quality of the final product out of my head. In other words, I try to not have expectations for a specific result or, if that\u0026rsquo;s too hard, I at least try to keep my expectations low.\nNot worrying about my goal\u0026rsquo;s final product makes it much easier to just start doing something. My ego is protected from failure, and I can utilize all the parts of my brain that live in the moment. Usually, the best final products are honed as they are made anyway - attempting to plan out the perfect product from the start without getting feedback from the work often just leads me to a state of analysis paralysis.\nSome great resources for goal execution:\n https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits  If getting started on a task is hard even with low/no expectations, or if I am stuck on said task and am having trouble re-starting, it is usually because the I don\u0026rsquo;t have the right understanding of the problem. Asking lots of questions and (re-)verifying all the assumptions I\u0026rsquo;ve made usually helps me get around this. If I\u0026rsquo;m really stuck, describing the issue in writing or to an outside observer will often give me to differing (and correct) perspective I need to move forward. I\u0026rsquo;m consistently amazed by how narrow my focus on problems can become compared to the focus a random outside observer would have.\n"});index.add({'id':38,'href':'/docs/mind/absorbing-and-professing/','title':"Absorbing and Professing",'content':" States of Mind These states can be mixed together, but are at their strongest when the mind is fully focused on one at a time.\nProfessing - Performing - A State of Action In this state, the information already contained in your neural patterns is simply being projected as is into the world onto some medium. This could be into the air as speech, onto paper as writing, or into your body as any physical activity (e.g. dancing, biking, etc.). In this model, pure professing involves no self reflection or change whatsoever. If there is adaptation to the unpredictable physical world, it is through if/then branches that choose simply between already constructed neural patterns.\nBeing in this state requires some combination of practice or training to build the mental patterns, and a framework of assumptions that keeps the mind from examining what it is doing too closely.\nIn the extreme, pure profession can be animalistic and stubborn. Being in a professing state leads to confidence and strong ego.\nBeing in this state can be physically draining, but mentally I find I can be in this state for a long time before needing a break.\nPeople tend to express this state more the older they get (i think).\nFlow Being in a strong professing state can lead to a \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; state, where the world is continually validating your stored patterns and it feels like everything is going \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;. I believe this state enables the acts of greatest skill or talent that are possible for people. This is a state of “effortless effort” as described in Zen philosophy.\nI think the key to flow is to always have a readily accessible pathway for your mind to take when it runs into an issue. Preparation/practice builds these pathways; it is easier to get into flow doing something you have done many times before.\nAbsorbing - Learning - A State of Observation In counter to profession, a state of absorption occurs when a mind is focused instead on taking in new information while making few/no assumptions about the world. In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually questions, expanding the problem space without looking at its details. This happens often when being exposed to new information or questioning assumptions one has about old information. New mental connections and memories are being created actively in this state.\nWhen in this state, a mind is very sensitive to any external feedback to correct its action. This can manifest as insecurity or anxiety if pressure is applied during this state of mind.\nThis state of mind can be paralyzing, as it lays bare the overwhelming complexity of everything as you continue to zoom out. However, it also leads to interesting connections that you may not see otherwise.\nExtreme absorption/mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless theorizing that is too far removed from reality to be useful. Also procrastination.\nYounger people tend to express this state more (i think). This thought inspired by “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan.\nBeing in this state is very draining, as your mind has to constantly reconfigure its thoughts reactively to match external feedback. For me to be most effective, I need to take short and long breaks from this state (even “sleeping on” what I’m learning) to solidify memories and make them “professable”. Too much raw absorption becomes counterproductive, as my mind is too tired to even hold on to the recent changes, let alone make more new ones.\nWhen learning in this state, there will almost always be blind alleys you must go down to eventually find a model of (or perspective on) the world that works. This explains why learning can be such a \u0026ldquo;stop and go\u0026rdquo; process - it\u0026rsquo;s easy to be stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks. Also I think one’s tolerance for blind alleys directly correlates to how good they are at learning.\n Inversion by James Clear  Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to succeed.   Switching states In order to get better at something, both absorbing AND professing are equally important often in alternating steps.\nSee this Skyline video for a description about how this process works for a game like Overwatch specifically.\nLearning how to do something new under pressure of your own or other’s expectations can be hard. Specifically, it is stressful to take mental pathways you have recently worked on as an absorber and apply them assuming they will work (with penalty for failure).\nSomeone who “thrives in ambiguity” is bold about applying untested pathways and has a low fear of failure - or has set expectations properly such that failure is not a big problem. Alternatively, this person is willing to take on perspectives and run with them even if there is a threat that their taken perspective does not match the perspective/expectations of others they are working with.\nIdeas to test  Do you actually have a worse memory for events that happened to you when in a professing state?  Focus This is unrelated to the above states of mind.\nOne way I think of focus is as getting buy in from your mind to fully engage in some work (mental or physical). Often the mind expects some pay off for doing this, since it takes energy and time to be fully engaged. This snippet by Jonathan Blow does a great job describing how focus can be disrupted (full interview).\nA good way to encourage focus is to set yourself up so that external “things I should also think about” are absent. For example:\n Writing thoughts down so that your brain doesn’t feel pressure to remember them (else they would be lost). Keeping your goals “in front” of you. This could mean laying out your workspace so that all that’s needed to do your task is at hand. This could mean keeping opponents in a game within your field of view. Being in a situation where you have to “turn your head around” physically or metaphorically to keep abreast can lead to breaks in focus. Putting walls up between yourself and other tasks, like by putting your phone in another room when trying to focus on something.  Another useful idea is to try to enumerate the things you want to do before starting on them. If this list is written down (or even remembered), going back to it can be a stimulus that competes with other environmental distractions or thoughts. For instance, a common pattern I notice is (1) I complete a task, (2) I have to refocus on something else, (3) some random environmental stimulus grabs my focus (e.g. an email, article, chore). When I have a list of things I want to do, then those become part of the set of environmental stimuli, making it more likely that I do them instead of something else. This system is most effective when the list is very accessible; this could mean physically at hand, or recently created so it is fresh in your mind. It also helps to consciously pause right after stage (1) above (completing a task), instead of directly jumping to the next thing with little thought - this simple pause really helps your next task be intentional and not dictated by your environment.\n"});index.add({'id':39,'href':'/docs/mind/brain-juice/','title':"Brain Juice",'content':" Brain Juice I\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly how, but I feel that my brain behaves similarly to my muscles in that it can tire on both short and long timescales when used.

If your body/mind are primed to do the task such that you could do it with minimal/no conscious intervention. For example walking, reading, or doing some trained skill are trivially easy. Note that this depends on the current state of your body; walking may not be trivially easy if you are exhausted or have a broken leg. And also the state of your mind; responding to a conversation may be hard if you haven\u0026rsquo;t caught up on what has been said.\nNote that the whole path to the objective does not have to be trivially easy or even known. All that matters where motivation is concerned is the next step (at least for attainability).\nMotivation can flag when the next step towards a goal is unclear. In such situations it\u0026rsquo;s easy to simply switch gears to another activity which has clear steps - this is procrastination.\nHow to make things attainable When something feels unattainable because either (a) it seems so hard you would fail if you tried or (b) its unclear what step to take next, I have found several tricks that work pretty well:\nThe first trick is to take a step back both from the problem at hand AND from anything else that engages your mind. The goal here is to put yourself in a state of boredom, then slightly nudge your thoughts toward your issue. Often I find my mind much more eagerly thinks about something when the prospect of boredom is there as an alternative. One way to do this is by going and sitting in another chair far from distractions.\nAnother alternative is going for a walk or run, preferably with no audio or other distractions. This method also usually engages my creativity, which helps open up new potential paths to issue resolution. There is the drawback that sometimes here my creativity will wander, and I will end up with good ideas about something other than my issue.\nThe second trick is to talk to someone about the issue. Sometimes the act of putting your issue into works can snap some clarity into it. The person your are talking to may also offer useful insights. Writing thoughts down can also sometimes work here, if no-one is available to talk to.\nThe third trick only applies when you find the task hard, but you see the path you would take to do it. In this case, for me listening to energetic music or putting myself in an energetic, stimulating, or even stressful environment (e.g. with other people around) can help me feel more active and therefore more able to do my hard task. I think part of this is that the stimulation occupies the higher level part of my mind that\u0026rsquo;s telling me the task is hard, and just lets the less conscious parts of me simply execute. Again, this only works for a case (a) above, not when it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what to do next. See the book \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo; for more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\nHow to make things LESS attainable When stuck on attainability, there are several counterproductive strategies:\nEating food in hopes that it will give you energy to push through. This always just makes me MORE tired especially in the short term. Plus I usually feel more able/energetic when I am slightly hungry.\nTrying to brute force your way through an issue without trying alternate routes. This sometimes works, but usually just makes me feel stupid and can lead to a vicious cycle where I continually burn more and more energy in less and less well directed ways trying to prove I am not stupid :). The key to avoiding this is making sure you aren\u0026rsquo;t following the same lines of thought over and over, and stopping if you find yourself doing so.\nThe tendency to try to brute force I find is more and more temping the most tired you are. One way to explain this is that as you do something hard (that you don\u0026rsquo;t already have mental circuits to handle) , your mind contracts/focuses on the problem until it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected event (or new solution idea) is hard to handle. This is counter to an \u0026ldquo;expanded\u0026rdquo; mind where many possibilities are open and easy to handle. If you have been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do something you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion. As discussed earlier, going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens this process. So going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no listening to anything, no conversations with people) is a great technique. Some of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of \u0026ldquo;How to Change Your Mind\u0026rdquo; by Michael Pollan.\n(Perceived) Meaning Activities are meaningful when they fit neatly into a larger narrative. This could be a grand narrative about one\u0026rsquo;s identity (e.g. defined by what virtues you aspire to or possess), or a myopic narrative about what puzzle piece should fit next into the puzzle to bring it closer to solution.\nWhat you or others may find meaningful in a certain situation varies a lot for many reasons. I have found myself obsessed with completing certain goals, and then having my obsession and motivation completely evaporate after reframing the larger context those goals fit into.\nOne way to lose motivation for a task is to follow the meaning of the task up through all the ways it impacts the world, coming to the final conclusion that there is no greater meaning in the world (or you don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is), and therefore the task itself is meaningless. This kind of \u0026ldquo;bubbling up\u0026rdquo; can happen on a smaller scale as well.\nTODO explore ideas from https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\n"});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/docs/music/','title':"Music",'content':" Music Roughly ordered by current into-ness.\nFlow/Immersive  hubris. jakob God is an Astronaut Night Verses Intervals 65daysofstatic Unprocessed  Pump  Russian Circles Zeal and Ardor  Catchy  Tender Metal Mother Pair of Arrows Neon Trees  Chill/Background  Ratatat El Ten Eleven Glitch Mob Tim Hecker Nick Johnston  "});index.add({'id':45,'href':'/docs/podcasts/','title':"Podcasts",'content':" Podcasts Have Listened  Programming Throwdown  Random discussions of programming languages and other topics Very casual  Radiolab  High production value stories   Am Listening  Joe Rogan Experience  Long and varied.

If there was someone more directly responsible for outcomes, that person would be directly incentivizes to put in the effort I think\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Idea spreaders right now are DEFINITELY not incentivizes to put in the effort, as you imply\u0026rdquo;\nLol inventivized\nIncentivized\n\u0026ldquo;Imo loosely regulated idea spreading is fine, as long as the people deciding what ideas are implemented actually test the stuff they implement and have responsibility for it going right\u0026rdquo;\nOf course if we can\u0026rsquo;t get the decision point right then we should probably regulate the idea spreading\nJust joining a work mtg fyi\n\u0026ldquo;I think the highest burden of rigor is only meant to be placed on experts researching some specific field, and there is a softer burden of critical thinking that should be placed on leaders. In a culture that values education, it would also be something valued/recognized a little more by everyone. The larger problem with leaders isn\u0026rsquo;t really effort imo, it\u0026rsquo;s integrity. Plenty of leaders are working very hard and putting in plenty of effort, just not towards the people\u0026rsquo;s interests, because there is some other incentive they care more about (?/influence/fame/power, idea spreaders want to get paid or be famous, politicians need favor with the right groups to be successful, etc.). On the systemic side, our systems need to incentivize integrity, because they don\u0026rsquo;t currently. On the people side, our culture could recognize and incentivize integrity more if the people recognize and value it more\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Many idea spreaders put in loads of effort, they are incredibly hard workers. But they\u0026rsquo;re not working to inform, they\u0026rsquo;re grifters\u0026rdquo;\nAnd it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how rigorous our experts are if culturally we don\u0026rsquo;t trust them and are more trusting of the grifters (and the grifted). Or if our leaders actively undermine them.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes true. I was assuming policy makers are not putting enough effort behind the task of rigorously deciding what \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; have rigorous evidence for their ideas, and that is why idea spreaders can work their ideas into implementation. Like you\u0026rsquo;re saying, policy makers also have their own biases that further disrupt their ability to pick the right idea. My thought is that if we can make it very clear/consequential when a wrong idea is implemented, maybe we can incentivize the selection of better ideas.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that scientists/experts should be held to high standards of rigor, but policy makers should be able to do the job of reviewing scientific work and ensuring that is in fact well done before running with it\u0026rdquo;\nOr they could just trust it if there is a very clear widespread consensus among the scientists who actually know how to review that work\n\u0026ldquo;I think getting people to listen to the experts at all comes first. And doing something about corrupt actors and grifters. That problem is much more insidious than an ordinary bias or issue of rigor, it comes down to honesty/integrity\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah +1 to getting people to listen to experts comes first. My proposed mechanism for how to do that in this conversation is to give decision makers more ownership/accountability/responsibility over their decisions, so that there are actual repercussions to not listening to experts. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that if we can tie trusting grifters to clear failure we can help fix this problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For example, setting some kind of goal or metric for healthcare costs (Andrew yang proposed doing this kind of thing in his platform) , then setting a target gives a clear pass/fail signal. Then politicians would propose plans that they think will pass. Then they try them and the failures are rigorously scrutinized and punished with e.g. no reelection\u0026rdquo;\nDoing this kind of thing on small scales first would minimize risk\nCo2 concentration in atmosphere is another good metric\nOr something more real that co2 impacts\nI also agree that a more informed/critical thinking populace is very important\n\u0026ldquo;I worry it\u0026rsquo;s not enough tho, or maybe not tangible enough?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Even informed ppl can be fooled, especially if they spend less time critically examining ideas than those people who carefully crafted the ideas\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah I agree, I definitely think where we can we should quantify things and look for feedback where we can (definitely a mathy approach with the great intention of trying to be objective) but I also think that can be really tricky with a lot if things, especially if we try to attribute blame/credit to specific people/decisions. If we set up the metrics poorly and put too much trust in them we run the risk of creating new gameable systems for people to exploit. Decisions may also be good for the long term but have short term costs, and decisions can have far-reaching effects which impact the metrics/data of future decisions and leaders. This is the kind of approach most corporations try to take and a common issue is that it becomes too focused on the short term, potentially at the expense of the long term. Whatever metrics we use should be chosen carefully, and the metrics will likely need to be changed/improved over time. And there are lots of things that will still need to be examined qualitatively, without a clear metric\n\u0026ldquo;\nYeah this stuff is messy : /\n\u0026ldquo;I think some of the biggest things that need changing are in infrastructure. There aren\u0026rsquo;t a lot of good direct metrics for that, it\u0026rsquo;s the kind of thing that\u0026rsquo;s really important to almost every area but in intangible/indirect ways. Still, there are clear problems with clear solutions there, a lot kf which relate to teasing out these bad incentives I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about and improving the strength and health of our democracy and checks and balances. Imo that is some of the most critical stuff that needs fixing, and it\u0026rsquo;s in the way of fixing so many other more direct/tangible things\u0026rdquo;\nYep. One thing I hope for in the future is that more people will be able to spend their time doing this stuff as our economy gets better at satisfying our basic needs.\n\u0026ldquo;I also agree that a more informed public has intangible impact and isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s another feature of the health/stability of our country. If we fixed all of our systems and made them much better but the public was still very uninformed, things could still devolve over time. I think structures (systems and policies) and culture (people, public opinion, values, opinions, education) are linked and it can be either a vicious spiral or a virtuous one\u0026rdquo;\nIt takes a lot of effort to find and champion the issues you\u0026rsquo;re talking about\nYep\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m glad we have this is text, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try to summarize this weekend and post as an essay/blog post\u0026rdquo;\nAt least for my own future reference\n\u0026ldquo;And the culture ones not tangible, it isn\u0026rsquo;t really even an issue we can fight for, it\u0026rsquo;s the rippling effect of all of our interactions and experiences\u0026rdquo;\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s ok with you\nYeah that lack of direct actionability bothers me : /\nYeah go for it\n\u0026ldquo;The thing you said about time is part of the argument tor things like UBI. The thing is, no matter how efficient our economy gets at producing, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily give the people time if there is artificial scarcity. As in, there is enough food/housing/whatever to go around but people don\u0026rsquo;t have access to it unless they work ridiculous hours (and maybe not even then). This is a really large topic, but it\u0026rsquo;s part of why people like to hate on capitalism recently. There are a lot of ways artificial scarcity is created for the sake of greed/profit, and if ? is what you care about, creating/maintaining artificial scarcity is actually what people with a lot of ? are incentivized to do in the current system\u0026rdquo;\n👍\n\u0026ldquo;If things \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;trickled down\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;, all the efficiency would benefit the people, but there is nothing in the system to make that so. It might sometimes in certain ways or might not. At the end of the day, the people with the money have the power for it to trickle or not and the system doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them\u0026rdquo;\nYeah we live in a very wierd society in that way. I guess at least it allows for interesting people like elon musk to exist\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m getting really tired of powerful people being so \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; haha\u0026rdquo;\n out at your place during the day, if nothing else just for a change of scenery )\u0026rdquo;   your place during the day, if nothing else just for a change of scenery )\u0026rdquo;  I\u0026rsquo;m free/down :)\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll try to find a break in the rain around midday if that\u0026rsquo;s cool\u0026rdquo;\nHari says he\u0026rsquo;s busy at 7\nOk np\nBut he\u0026rsquo;s free the rest of the day\n👍\nOn way\n👍\nBtw we birding up now\n\u0026ldquo;Another point about socialism: whenever a well-regarded historical figure supports socialism or other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;radical\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; ideas (not actually radical but things we tend to strawman as radical), we tend to filter that out whenever we teach/celebrate that person\u0026rsquo;s achievements. E.g. MLK was a democratic socialist, so was bertrand russell. But also apparently there\u0026rsquo;s more technicalities to the definitions of different kinds of socialism which I don\u0026rsquo;t totally understand, like social democrat and democratic socialist are 2 different kinds of socialism that are both not the scary communism kind. There might be other kinds that have been tried before, idk\u0026rdquo;\nThat historical whitewashing doesn\u0026rsquo;t just apply to people but also historical examples of successful democratic socialist governments\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m reading the last book MLK wrote and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing so far. He touches on some of what we talked about wrt anger and emotion. He points out that rage can replace reason if we let it but also says people need to rise up with indignation to demand necessary reforms be instituted. So blind reasonless rage is bad, but properly directed, rational moral indignation is good. Not just good but necessary for the right change to occur. Sending snaps of the actual quotes\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rocklike intransigence\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (people become entrenched and won\u0026rsquo;t change their minds) and \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (e.g. propaganda and maliciously strategic actions like voter suppression, gerrymandering, undermining or circumventing democracy) captures the major ways progress is difficult even when you have a good solution which could fix or vastly improve a problem if implemented. Maintaining a large complex system that works for the people is already difficult work (like it is in software engineering) but these other forces add a whole new level of difficulty, which comes from antagonistic humans abusing their power and platforms. That part of the struggle is not a systems design problem, it is more like a battle. These bad actors (think of them as black hat hackers) are very driven, and it will take a lot of collective drive from the public to get change through despite their efforts (preferably more from reasonable indignation than reasonless rage. But the less productive rage will always be there unless the problem improves)\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There is a pattern throughout history where if a tension like this exists and worsens over time, the anger and frustration becomes more intense and widespread until it leads to revolution (a violent and chaotic one if rage wins out)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You can break down the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;sophisticated manipulation\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; by manipulation of people and culture (propaganda) or systemic manipulation (the other \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;maliciously strategic\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stuff I mentioned). A lot of propaganda serves to diffuse reasonable/justified indignation so change is less likely to occur (downplay the severity or validity of the problem), or redirect it to something else (twisting things away from the source of the problem to the wrong cause, or even another completely fake issue). But if problems persist, some kind of rage always remains, however it is processed/directed\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Problems in infrastructure are more abstract and less clearly/directly tied to the problems people get emotional about. I think it\u0026rsquo;s because of that lack of emotional drive that it\u0026rsquo;s especially hard to get changes through in those areas. This is also part of why I think the perspective of math is important, not just because it allows us to see things in a clear and objective way (as clear/objective as humanly possible), but it also gets us thinking about abstract ideas and structure. Better math education means the public is more comfortable doing that\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok I\u0026rsquo;m done spamming you with walls of text for now, sorry\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s interesting! And yeah I think rage/passion is necessary sometimes to keep people behind a cause. Im maybe in denial about it\u0026rsquo;s usefulness\n\u0026ldquo;More generally, imo the harm of emotion comes down to \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reacting before thinking/reasoning\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;. But reacting AFTER thinking things through (and also being open to the idea that you might be wrong and being willing to rethink) is perfectly rational. Furthermore, sometimes strong emotions indicate a person is MORE aware of reality, not the other way around. If you notice your house is on fire and your emotional state is exactly the same as if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t on fire, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that makes you \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;, it\u0026rsquo;s more likely you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet come to terms with the fact that your house is on fire.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah I agree. I will say that from a completely naive observers perspective, the fact that someone is strongly emotional is not necessarily correlated to their viewpoint being accurate. And since emotions often demand strong reaction (e.g. support), a completely naive observer may be savvy to avoid the situation to avoid backing the wrong perspective (e.g. propaganda). Of course, this only applied for naive observers who haven\u0026rsquo;t seen all perspectives and don\u0026rsquo;t have enough info.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In any discussion, ideas exist separately from people and can be examined on their own merit, regardless of the perceived emotional state of the person presenting them or any other details not relevant to what is/isn\u0026rsquo;t true or valid. What this comes down to is rhetoric vs epistemology, \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;winning the debate\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; vs getting at the truth/validity of the ideas themselves. The former isn\u0026rsquo;t rational, it\u0026rsquo;s just what\u0026rsquo;s effective. The latter is how we can actually try to be rational, and we can try to take that approach as much as possible in a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; way to learn as much as possible from any discussion, isolating/evaluating all points made by all sides independently.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric is still an important tool, and it can be used virtuously or viciously. Virtuous rhetoric might simplify things or illustrate things in imperfect ways but minimize the gap between that and reality (and often uses careful wording to draw attention to the oversimplification or caveats of a point), vicious rhetoric maximizes the gap ruthlessly to win the debate at all costs, only simulating virtuosity where necessary as a further rhetorical strategy\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Really, savvy observers know the difference between rhetoric and valid logic/methodology and can see through vicious rhetoric. Education makes vicious rhetoric less effective and virtuous rhetoric more effective\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not just education, but also emotional intelligence and wisdom, to know your own biases and common poor shortcuts, and learn how to change or correct for them. Or even just knowing when they\u0026rsquo;re there in a big way, and having a healthy dose of doubt/skepticism as a result\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If your level of certainty is much higher than your level of knowledge/understanding of a particular area, it\u0026rsquo;s a sure sign of some bad shortcuts. It could be a wrong belief that\u0026rsquo;s held onto strongly and forced into any lens we look through, it could be we think of certain ideas as completely interchangeable when they\u0026rsquo;re not (but may still be related in a weaker way), it could be a type of confident and charismatic speaking really appeals to us, speech that is unemotional in tone, etc.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For me this is one of the most productive aspects of thinking about these things - you learn a lot about yourself and other people along the way, in ways that can\u0026rsquo;t be planned or forseen. If you decide to take some kind of action, you\u0026rsquo;ll do so in a less half-baked way. And even if you don\u0026rsquo;t do anything with a direct outsized impact, this process of honest examination, careful thought and introspection can have rippling positive effects on the world and yourself\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was talking with Claire some more about this and it\u0026rsquo;s becoming more clear to me (partially based on her observations of me) that I am currently uncomfortable with ethos and pathos based arguments because I see them as shortcuts to an end goal that can hide problems. This feeling has persisted strongly in me probably because I haven\u0026rsquo;t faced challenges where those shortcuts are necessary to succeed. You are right that real rhetoric is necessary to accomplish societal goals; I think I personally just haven\u0026rsquo;t faced many/any of them so I don\u0026rsquo;t see it\u0026rsquo;s true value. As you can already maybe see from our conversations, I (currently) take a more passive approach to these issues in an attempt to understand them deeply (mistrusting shortcuts), maybe idealistically thinking that I even can do that. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this would win me much success in changing hearts/minds or even doing anything at all besides avoiding or running from the problem.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I agree that virtuous rhetoric is very useful, and distrusting ALL rhetoric makes learning anything really hard. I think some people selectively take the \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reject all rhetoric\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; stance to avoid inconvenient truths\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026rdquo;(but they have to believe some rhetoric, like I do)\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I deeply distrust rhetoric and shortcuts and I think it\u0026rsquo;s healthy. I am not advocating for taking more shortcuts internally, but rather for awareness of the shortcuts that exist and a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;best effort\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; to prune/refine them and not put certainty in them or hold onto them so tightly. This is why I also prefer cooperative discussion to competitive debate. In the former, rhetoric is not necessarily needed (or if it is needed it\u0026rsquo;s not relied on as heavily) and both parties benefit from understanding each other fully without appeals or posturing, and it can also be a more honest/open conversation, without fear of showing something which could be perceived as weakness (expressing emotion, admitting to not knowing certain things, admitting to mistakes in thinking, being wrong, etc.). Openness requires that all parties in the discussion can see past the rhetorical shortcuts and are invested in understanding the best version of what each person has to say (steel-manning), while allowing cooperative corrections/refinement of the ideas for everyone\u0026rsquo;s benefit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m also advocating for understanding rhetoric, how it fools other people and how we fool ourselves. We are not logical emotionless robots no matter how hard we try to be, and trying to view ourselves in that way tends to decrease our self awareness, hurting our ability to see our biases/shortcuts clearly. The shortcuts/biases are still there but we lose our greatest tool for finding them and push them further out of our conscious thoughts, making them more likely to deepen than to diminish. If we do this emotional suppression and also convince ourselves we\u0026rsquo;re being rational, we run the risk of becoming overly certain and confident in ourselves while being less aware of the weakness of our own thinking.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Rhetoric becomes important when speaking to people who we aren\u0026rsquo;t sure we can have that kind of nice, healthy discussion I described with or when we speak with any kind of platform. I think the distrust of emotional people thing you were describing IS a rhetorical shortcut based on ethos. Full logos would take what is said and consider it for its own merit, based on logic and whatever other evidence/methodology is being used, treating things like emotional tone as just noise, not relevant to the ideas (this is how an emotionless robot would interpret what is said).\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you were to eliminate all shortcuts and maintain perfect awareness of your assumptions, you\u0026rsquo;d be doing math (or what math aspires to be, there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee mathematicians don\u0026rsquo;t also make mistakes, but at least everything stated so clearly and unambiguously that the mistakes are not so hidden). Everything past that is progressively less solid and more uncertain, which is fine as long as you have some awareness and flexibility.\n\u0026ldquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And yeah, people move the goalposts all the time for how rigorous/logical arguments need to be to be convincing and hold inconsistent standards for evaluating truth (as high as possible for opponents and as low as possible for themselves). People are suddenly very skeptical and great at finding flaws when looking at something they don\u0026rsquo;t want to believe.\u0026rdquo;\nSorry for writing another essay :p\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s great, I\u0026rsquo;M sorry I haven\u0026rsquo;t been responding as elequently : P. Good point about the emotional -\u0026gt; less trust bridge being ethos based. That\u0026rsquo;s a good perspective; and it makes it easier for me to see that my correlation there is not necessarily \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;reasonable\u0026rdquo;\u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIssues with Reasoning\nTo improve our condition in the world, one of the best tools we humans have is \u0026ldquo;distributed reasoning\u0026rdquo;. I\u0026rsquo;ll define this as the ability of people to build useful models of the world in their heads based on models of the world communicated to them by other people. Through this process, new people, or people new to an area of knowledge can shortcut the learning process, enabling novel stuff to happen.\nHere I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that the majority of communication that enabled distributed reasoning is rhetorical in nature; that is, it involves an asymmetric exchange between a teacher trying to persuade a student of something. I use the word \u0026ldquo;persuade\u0026rdquo; because it captures the changing of mind that is required when learning something new - or unlearning something.\nBecause our minds have limited memory, attention span, and processing power, teachers must provide incomplete arguments in their lessons. It is impossible in most cases to provide an airtight explanation for why what the teacher is saying is right. To keep arguments persuasive, teachers often fall back on assumptions, appeals to authority (e.g. \u0026ldquo;what this expert says is the gold truth\u0026rdquo;), appeals to common sense (e.g. \u0026ldquo;this is obvious\u0026rdquo;), or appeals to emotion (e.g. statistics presented in a scary way).\nAlthough this may seem problematic, it\u0026rsquo;s actually necessary to employ these techniques because, practically, people need to learn and have limited resources with which to do so. An alternative, pure epistemology is usually too slow in most contexts. For those who need to make real decisions now, going down epistemologic rabbit holes is a good recipe for failure.\nIn most cases, this system works extremely well. People learn skills quickly with it and, if the teacher\u0026rsquo;s lesson was misleading, they get fast feedback when what they are trying to do fails. This is very clear in trade-like contexts, like programming or building stuff. Hard science education also uses this system well. Most models of the world taught to students in science classes have serious problems with them, but are still useful stepping stones on the path to either further understanding or useful application.\nA bit of a breakdown occurs when the decisions people make based on rhetorical arguments have unclear or delayed consequences. Here is where being more epistemological becomes very useful. However, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes even unclear when decisions even have unclear results! For example, a clear cause-effect relationship with a subtle, hard-to-notice additional effect. These relationships are everywhere in complex systems like human societies.\nOver history our ability to execute rhetorical communication has only improved due to the written word and other media. In the last generation the ability of any person to participate both as a teacher and a student has been scaled up to a global level.\nThis intensification of our ability to distributed-ly reason, coupled with the unclear cause-effect relationships found in the complex systems we are reasoning about leads us to some unpleasant problems. Chief among these is the rampant application of very focused rhetorical arguments to societal problems. Anyone can throw down an argument with holes or that doesn\u0026rsquo;t consider the full picture and gain a following, since people are historically very used to absorbing such arguments. Since societal problems are so complex, thinking epistemological-ly more often than not leads to dead ends or unless findings, which further discourages eager activists from taking that route.\nSo, as a result, we find ourselves in a sticky situation. The complexity of our world has become daunting, but the average quality of our solutions to its problems are low. Therefore, the effort required to dig through and find a good solution is increasing.\nUnfortunately, the personal incentives/consequences for doing/not doing this work don\u0026rsquo;t always seem to be aligned with its importance. One great example is economic policy - punishment for failures is pretty low1. It is too easy for thought leaders to recommend arguments for implementation without consequences when those arguments lead to problems. This is especially problematic when those thought leaders have incentives other than those of the people they are serving.\n See writings of Nicholas Taleb [return]   "});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/docs/society-and-economics/','title':"Society and Economics",'content':" Interesting Talks/Articles  Downsides of Meritocracy  Excessive work justifying class is harmful for everyone, particularly the wealthy.

This way the graph of knowledge is approachable, and essays/papers don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about not mentioning things, since they are still notes. Later essays can keep exploring the unguided territory.\nThis system has the benefit of encouraging new essays to form from the body of work, which is always at hand and even partially connected already.\n"});index.add({'id':51,'href':'/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe/','title':"What to Believe",'content':" What to Believe In order to make good decisions, people need to build an understanding of how the world works by gathering information. Luckily, it is getting easier and easier to do this as technology becomes more and more efficient at sending data around the world. Unfortunately, simply gathering information is not enough; one must also make sure that the information is of high enough quality to use in world modelling or decision making.\nThere are many reasons why information people share with each other may be misleading or wrong.\nhttps://thedietwars.com/how-to-determine-who-is-a-legitimate-science-based-health-expert/\nStories To transfer information, people share stories with each other. These stories get etched in people\u0026rsquo;s minds as they hear them, and can get more deeply etched with repetition or other validation.\nMany (technically most) stories are not accurate descriptions of the real, physical world.\nInaccurate stories can be useful. For instance, they can be \u0026ldquo;stepping stones to the truth\u0026rdquo;, like our story about how electrons are particles that orbit the nucleus of an atom (Bohr model). They can also provide practical ways to encourage a behavior; for instance, the story that virtuous people are rewarded in the afterlife. Or auervedic medicine promoting health.\nUnfortunately, inaccuracy can also lead to bad decision making with serious consequences. To be safe, it would be ideal if we could clearly determine inaccuracy and weight that in our consideration of whether or not to use the story in informing our behavior.\nStory Plausability vs Accuracy Firstly, it is important to know that plausability DOES NOT correlate well with accuracy, especially in complex systems. There are many, many more plausable statements about systems like our economy or the human body that there are statements which are actually true. Some random examples (NOT MY OPINIONS):\nHealth  Any dietary sugar crystallizes in the blood, causing arterial damage. Sugar has no harmful effects on the body when \u0026lt;50g/day are consumed. Saturated fat hardens in the blood, clogging arteries. Saturated fat does not clog arteries.  Economy  Poor people are poor because they don\u0026rsquo;t work hard. Poor people are poor because powerful people with malicious intent are taking their resources. Poor people are poor because our economy makes it hard to increase your net worth.  Education  Girls and boys have inherent (from birth) differences in what topics they are interested in, and therefore end up finding careers in. Girls and boys have the same chance to become interested in something at birth, but are unevenly distributed in careers due to how they are raised.  More theories like this that were widely believed but are now disproven can be found on this Wikipedia page.\nNote that some stories can be completely true, but still not have the effect they imply. For instance, certain foods contain toxins that kill and/or mutate our cells. But this does not mean that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat those foods (perhaps every foods falls into this category?).\nFor each of the above statements/stories, there are groups of people who would find them plausible. Since some directly contradict each other, how are we to know which to believe?\nThe Scientific Method We can use scientific reasoning to falsify inaccurate stories! Ideally, we would do this for all information we incorporate into our decisions; if no one has tried to falsify a certain piece of information, then we probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use it for important decision making.\nUnfortunately, science is really hard, so many falsification studies have not been done. Additionally, science doesn\u0026rsquo;t give hard yes-or-no answers - it gives probabilities (e.g. p-values) that something might be true given a long list of assumptions or constraints. In order to accurately incorporate a scientific finding into a justification for making a certain decision, all these uncertainties should be understood.\nIt is hard to do this, just like it is hard to come up with scientific findings in the first place. If we as a society deeply recognized this difficulty, it may give more respect to good scientific findings, and help us have more informed debated about what actions to take on big important issues. This recognition may also make people more patient and willing to embrace the difficulty, instead of looking for shortcuts.\n(I have nothing against finding the most efficient ways to solve problems, except when these shortcuts are less rigorous or otherwise worse than harder solutions AND we pretend that they are just as good just because of their convenience).\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper\nPeople and Stories When it comes to deciding what stories are accurate, or worth etching deeply into your own mind, it is important to select stories which have had a lot of effort put towards their falsification, but still hold up. To verify this process, it is ideal to try your hardest to falsify the story in question yourself.\nLooking at what others believe is a good way to find new stories, and also can be a good way to vet stories. It is crucial however to think about WHY believers trust the stories they do. If they have not actively tried to falsify their own stories, that is a red flag that their belief may not be sound. Evidence that people have tried this falsification includes:\n Advertisement of conditions under which their story does not hold true. Write ups of experiments that were done in the effort of falsification.  At a higher level, if the person in question has a history of changing their believes when shown new evidence, that is also a good sign.\nFor those people who have a long history of believing the same story, or have financial or social incentives to believe said story, be wary that their confirmation bias may blind them a bit to new information.\nIn extreme cases, people who do not try to falsify their own stories can become zealots; so blind to the limitation of their own beliefs that there is no practical difference between them and someone who is intentionally promoting a belief they know to be wrong (lying).\nOne thing to note is that people holding hard to old beliefs seems to be a natural thing for humans to do, and there are ways to exploit this without changing people\u0026rsquo;s minds:\n VSauce reasoning video_ Antifragile discusses how it might be ideal to have many strongly supported ideas fight it out in e.g. a market to find the best ones and move the whole system forward optimally.  This is related to the idea of \u0026ldquo;science advances one funeral at a time\u0026rdquo;, which assumes that (1) famous accomplished sciences direct future research and (2) these scientists have entrenched beliefs. These things combined mean new research directions that do not fit into the beliefs of the accomplished scientists do not get funding/attention. It would be nice if this wasn\u0026rsquo;t as true, but at the least there is still advancement *shrug*.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash; OLD THOUGHTS BELOW HERE \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nOne useful lens to look at this further is to think about where the shared information is ultimately coming from:\nFrom Past Personal Experience What works Tinkerers (as described in the book Antifragile) are people who use feedback from a specific task to improve and eventually become experts at doing that task. For instance a self-taught woodworker will eventually learn how to create complex wooden structures based on past experience of how wood behaves when he or she does things to it. Or a chess player may learn that certain patterns of pieces are dangerous or safe over time after winning or losing many games.\nInformation derived from tinkerers is:\n Often very practically useful Rarely completely \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, just maybe only right in a very narrow scope.  But has these problems:\n Deeper theories or reasons behind why the information is what it is are often absent or unrecoverable. This limits the scope at which the information can be accurately applied. Reproducing the logic behind the information can be very difficult or impossible, since it requires walking though the life experience of the tinkerer. This can make it easy for the tinkerer to hide bias.  "});index.add({'id':52,'href':'/docs/','title':"Docs",'content':""});index.add({'id':53,'href':'/','title':"Introduction",'content':" Welcome!
