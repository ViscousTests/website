Fragile - hurt by random variation Robust - not sensitive to anything Antifraile - hurt by lack of variation\nConvexity/Concavity The fragile is well represented by a concave distribution - outcomes are fine most of the time, but can sometimes be catastrophic.\nThe antifragile is well represented by a convex distribution - outcomes are fine most of the time, but can sometimes be very good.\nTheorizing vs Tinkering Theorizing involves making many (tested or untested) logical steps to explain a behavior. This is most effective in simple systems with little self-interaction (e.g. toy physics models). When applied to complex systems, theorizing can be fragile.\nRandom tinkering is done by making immediate decisions (hopefully with multiple options) in a more near-sighted way. The results of these decisions feed back into the process, hopefully stumbling the tinkerer closer to a solution. This is antifragile - your expectations are low most of the time, but sometimes you stumble onto something very groundbreaking.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/art/','title':"Art",'content':" Art Source can be found at https://github.com/kovasap/generative-art.\n perlin flow double helix  TODO: Add images with links instead of this bulleted list\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/art/double-helix/','title':"Double Helix",'content':" Double Helix  \n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/docs/art/perlin-flow/','title':"Perlin Flow",'content':" Perlin Flow  \n"});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/docs/brain-notes/','title':"Brain Notes",'content':" Mind as Multiple Actors Informed by: - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film) - https://www.eagleman.com/incognito\nI find a useful way to think about my mind is as a congress of many (simple-ish) actors.\nMyers-Briggs Type Indication (MBTI) Extroverted - Introverted Intuitive - Observant One perspective: If your brain is trying to build a wall of information, a more Observant mind will use bricks it finds with its senses in the world around it (either via memories or present sensations).

This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently perfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many times. This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not important, even if sometimes they are crucially so.\nReading this made me think of the process of climbing, which has many such steps. So, in the interest of not skipping these steps myself, here is my attempt at a Manifesto style checklist. As in the book, I tried to make this checklist as useful and evidence driven as possible. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to make it short enough to be usable, yet not skipping any steps that commonly lead to injuries/death.\nBefore writing the checklist, I wanted to get an idea of what mistakes most commonly cause injuries when climbing. According to The edidemiology of mountaineering and rock climbing accidents, in Grand Teton National Park from 1981 to 1986 these were:\n Bad fall, usually on lead (34 cases). Rock fall when climbing (11 cases). Getting lost off route (6 cases). Rappelling off the rope end (1 case). Rappelling with a bad anchor (2 cases). Not using proper protection (7 cases). Not using a rope (4 cases)! Not wearing a helmet (3 cases).  Most of the injuries discussed in the paper happened on show/ice, which I\u0026rsquo;m ignoring for the purposes of this checklist.\nInterestingly, most of these injuries occurred on the easiest routes (5.1-5.3!), which is in line with most of the anecdotes in The Checklist Manifesto.\nAnother study, \u0026ldquo;Rock climbing rescues in Boulder County, Colorado and Eldorado Canyon State Park\u0026rdquo;, has similar statistics. This study references a similar Australian study with more interesting results.\nHere is the current checklist:\nBEFORE CLIMBING: - Ensure harnesses are on correctly. - Ensure belay device is locked and through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope is tied through two harness hard points. - Ensure rope has stopper knot at non-climber end. - Determine if any extended slings will be needed to avoid rope running over rock. - Discuss rock fall hazard and what to do if it happens. BEFORE RAPPELLING: - Ensure both ends of rope have stopper knots. - Weight rope while still using personal anchors.

Therefore, I generally keep my screen at a low brightness level.\nOn Linux I use Redshift to keep my screen at a low temperature (low 3000Ks). Currently I use a constant temperature all the time, as opposed to making the color lower at night.\nOn Windows I use f.lux with default settings (changing color over the day). I frequently mess with the color temperature slider based on what I am doing.\nSelective Window Brightness On Linux I prefer dark, lower contrast color schemes for coding or working on the command line. They feel easier on my eyes and allow for more variety of color for use in (for example) syntax highlighting. I find that colors blend into light backgrounds more, and are therefore less readable.\nHowever, most documents in the world are rendered with black text on a white background. I find this perfectly readable, but starkly different from my dark color schemes. This makes it quite jarring to switch between the two, which I often do when I\u0026rsquo;m writing or coding while looking at a reference document in my web browser.\nTo fix this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a couple things:\n Using a page dimmer in my web browser.  This is generally a good solution, but (since these usually inject dimming javascript or css into the page that is being viewed) does not work when viewing web browser settings or reading pdfs or using any UI that is not strictly on the page.  Boosting the brightness of my terminal and dimming everything globally.  Works for all light colored programs! The best way I could find to do this was to take the colors in the terminal colorscheme (as hex strings) and increase their brightness value to make new hex string colors, which I used as my colorscheme. This definitly makes the terminal brighter but, as the brightness goes up, colors start maxing out util they all become white (#ffffff). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to boost brightness enough with this trick while keeping my colors distinct.   The current solution I have is to selectively apply color filters to different programs using Compton. This is not a feature that Compton supports natively, so I had to apply a patch I found here. The patched code can be found here. To configure this method, you can add shaders (functions that change pixel colors) to the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in the root of that repository. I run it by adding this to my ~/.xinitrc:\n~/.xinitrc --- compton --glx-prog-win-rule ~/compton/compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl:'class_g=\u0026quot;Google-chrome\u0026quot;' --backend glx -b  Another idea I had to help fix my problem was to selectively dim brighter pixels, while keeping dimmer pixels unchanged. I read that using the HSV color encoding could provide a good way to define what \u0026ldquo;brighter\u0026rdquo; means and a way to change it. Luckily, Compton provided a easy way to mess with this! My fiddling can be found in the compton-chg-saturate-brightness-contrast.glsl file in my fork of the Compton repository. One thing I tried here was to use a function like this to map the \u0026ldquo;value\u0026rdquo; (V in HSV) to a dimmer value (notice how higher V values are \u0026ldquo;dimmed\u0026rdquo; more than lower ones).\nOne fun tool for this experimentation was a color picker like this one. When changing the shader, the 2d color picker would have its colors changed, verifying the change made in the shader! For example, after setting the shader to map V values above 0.8 to 0.0, I could see the part of the color picker with those values turn black.\nIn the end, I may just stick with selectively dimming entire bright windows globally, as opposed to dimming certain colors. But it was fun to mess with and I may return to it in the future!\nAnother thing to try going forward would be other color representation models, such as CIELAB or YCbCr.\nOn Windows Because I often game on windows, I prefer to have my secondary monitor be dimmer than the primary to not distract from the game I\u0026rsquo;m playing, but still be there to look stuff up. I use the exellent Pangolin Screen Brightness utility to do this.\n"});index.add({'id':10,'href':'/docs/divinity-os2-build-idea/','title':"Divinity Os2 Build Idea",'content':"Skills: - Adrenaline (1 scoundrel) - Battering Ram (1 warfare) - Battle Stomp (1 warfare) - Crippling Blow (1 warfare) - Enrage (2 warfare) - Phoenix Dive (2 warfare) - Whirlwind (2 warfare) - Challenge (3 warfare) maybe - Tentacle lash (1 polymorph) - Heart of Steel (1 polymorph) - Smoke Cover (1 aero, 1 scoundrel) - Teleportation (2 aero) - Nether Swap (2 aero) - Uncanny Evasion (2 aero)\nPut points into abilities enough to learn skills, then the rest into 2-handed\n"});index.add({'id':11,'href':'/docs/event-reports/2020-8-10-lake-erie/','title':"2020 8 10 Lake Erie",'content':" Lake Erie Climbing Matthew\u0026rsquo;s review and recap of the day: "});index.add({'id':12,'href':'/docs/event-reports/2020-8-12-mile-high-club/','title':"2020 8 12 Mile High Club",'content':" Mile High Club A climb I discovered on Mountain Project to do while I was in the area on a camping trip.\nWe started the day a bit after 8, taking a quick sub-30 minute drive to get to the trailhead from our camp site. The road down to the Sunrise Mine trailhead was a bit rough in places, with at least a single large washout that I was impressed our large van could handle - the clearance was better that I thought! Our hike down the trailhead started around 8:30ish, after a quick banana/peanut butter breakfast.\nThe hike in was really pretty, with 3-4 stream/river crossings and some amazing mountain views as the trees thinned. Pardon the mediocre image quality : ).\nMatthew on the trail\nEventually the trail turned into a treeless alpine meadow\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;and then into a talus field. The transition was marked by this cute campsite.\nA short ways up we saw this ice cave, reminiscent of the Big Four Ice caves we visited the previous day:\nOn the talus, the trail became hard to follow, and we lost it on our way up. We knew we had to leave the trail at some point, but were not sure which direction (should have brought a map\u0026hellip;). Luckily we eventually found this trail marker, which marked our fork left, with the pass trail going right.\nEmbarrassingly, it took us a bit to disambiguate which of the peaks we were actually planning to climb\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;but we found it eventually!\nAs we closed in on the peak the Mountain Project description for how to approach got a lot clearer, as did the pass tail with its many switchbacks.\nThis reddish colored rock with a slight trickle of water marked the end of our hike and the start of our climb. We stopped here briefly for our last banana+bread wraps, left our bag on a ledge, and continued up! Our climb started at around noon; we lost some time on the approach pathfinding.\nThe climb up was very easy to track both by scanning for the bright, new bolts and referencing the Mountain Project description. The first pitch had a very obvious start, with three close bolts through a slightly overhanging juggy start. It was a bit intimidating as a first lead, but quickly confidence boosting as I realized the moves were actually quite natural.\nLooking down from the first belay.\nThe second pitch was more relaxed, and the third, long, pitch had a couple sections of hiking-with-a-rope. The views were beautiful the whole way.\nMatthew starting up pitch 4 or 5.\nThe summit!?\nLooking back at the switchbacked pass trail from a better vantage.\nWe reached the summit at around 4pm (behind schedule), but were treated with an amazing view anyway : ).\nLooking over into the next valley. The snow reminded me of the lava flows in the Lord of the Rings films. I wonder if they shot those scenes by just recoloring snow?\nOfficial! Funnily enough some of our friends from the UW IMA had just summited a week before.\nRappelling down was met with some trickiness at first; our first rope through went a bit off route and we needed to find our way back kinda awkwardly. The next couple rappels were very straightforward, until we got to pitch 3.\nFirstly, this pitch was very long to rappel. I remember having to daisy-chain some quickdraws together in order to keep a hold of both rope ends, but still couldn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the anchors. Instead I had to stop at this tree with a sling around it (perhaps others had the same issue).\nOnce Matthew had also rappelled down, we decided to pull the rope through and belay each other off the tree as we walked down to the ~20ft away anchors. This is where we ran into another snag:\nSo far, I had been rappelling down the climb with this technique:\nImage source: https://ropeandsummit.wordpress.com/technique/belaying-rappeling/\nThis allowed me to use my GriGri for a more comfortable and safer rappel. Unfortunately, this method had the before unforseen drawback of making it much easier for the rope to get stuck in constrictions when pulling it through. This is exactly what happened when pulling our rope through on this pitch. Our knot got stuck about 5 feet from the upper anchor, and no amount of wiggling and pulling would set it free!\nVery very luckily, the other end of the rope was still in reach. I was able to grab it, pull it down, attach my GriGri, and then part climb/part jug up the whole climb back to the anchors. I noticed a clear spot where the knot had gotten stuck. I am extremely grateful that this spot was not further down the climb; had we not been able to use the other rope end to climb up we would have been very stuck. I then set up a more traditional rappel, rappelled down, and pulled the rope with no issues.\nThis extra \u0026ldquo;climb\u0026rdquo; burned even more time, and now we were very eager to make a hasty descent. We quickly finished the rest of our rappels and started scrambling back to the trail over the talus fields.\nBy the time we had reached the trail proper, the sun was already (beautifully) setting.\nWith the solid trail beneath our feet, we started moving faster, breaking almost into a jog as the trail got flatter. On the way down, we passed a very tired, but very chilled out family hiking up on a backpacking trip. Their calming influence was very welcome.\nOnce we had made it into the forest, we had to pull out our phone flashlights, as it was now completely dark. We managed to do this part of the trail in record time, only getting lost a bit on the largest river crossing. Luckily we were both able to quickly retrace our steps and re-locate the trail on the other side of the river without too much more time.\nWe got to the car around 9:30pm and drove as quickly as we could to get back to our campsite just after they closed at 10pm. The gatekeeper took pity on us and let us in without a fine or any other trouble. Our fellow campers were pretty worried about us though. Reflecting back on our botch rappel this trip made me realize that I really want to either have cell service or a satellite communication device the next time I go on a trip like this.\nBesides our rushed finish, this climb was truly spectacular. It was also a great sport -\u0026gt; alpine climbing introduction. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go so far as to call it \u0026ldquo;pleasure climbing\u0026rdquo; like a roped soloer we met two days before at Mt. Erie called it, but it was a really cool alpine climbing experience. Just make sure you give yourself enough time!\n"});index.add({'id':13,'href':'/docs/fasting/','title':"Fasting",'content':" Fasting Fasting Mimicking Diet - January 2020 I started getting interested in fasting after reading The Longevity Diet by Valter Longo. Based on the information in the book, it seemed like fasting provided some easily attainable health benefits, if making it a habit wasn\u0026rsquo;t too disruptive to my life. My first experiment happened shortly after reading the book. I attempted a DIY-Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD) as described in the book for 5 days.\nI used eatthismuch to pre-plan my meals for the FMD. I think it would have been much harder for me to adhere to the diet if I did not do this. Here is what I ate:\nIf my memory serves me well, I remember feeling quite good during my fast, which some minor headaches on day 2-3. I did this during my vacation from work, and I don\u0026rsquo;t remember working intensely on any particular project during this time, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t consider this a \u0026ldquo;stress test\u0026rdquo; of the diet.\nWater Only Fast - December 2020 Further exposure to fasting proponents, especially Peter Attia (via e.g. his podcast with Eileen White, made me think about the simpler prospect of doing a water only fast. I finally attempted this during a work week in December 2020. My schedule looked like:\n Tuesday:  Large Spinach, Tomato, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Italian Seasoning Salad for lunch Some walnuts for dinner  Wednesday:  Only water  Thursday:  4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate (in water) + steak seasoning  Friday:  4ish servings of Better Than Bouillion stock concentrate + potassium containing spice mix   Here are the stock ingredients I used:\nI felt surprisingly normal during my fast. Especially when exercising - I went on my normal ~3 mile run on Thursday with 25 * 2 sets of push ups and 10 * 3 sets of pull ups interspersed and felt actually better than I normally do. Perhaps this was because of the water/glycogen weight I lost at the start of the fast (~5 lbs, 190lbs -\u0026gt; 185lbs).\nThere were times when I felt a bit lightheaded also during the fast, but never too seriously. This may have been a bit psychological, since I knew I was fasting.\nOne thing I also noticed was it was even harder than normal for me to keep warm in my ~65F apartment, especially when sleeping. The Wed-Thurs night I did not sleep very well because of this. Any kind of draft under the blankets was very noticeable and interrupted my sleep. I think wearing long underwear or other pajamas of some kind would have helped (usually I sleep close to naked).\nI did notice some tingling in my arms/legs, especially when putting a acute force on them. For instance, when doing push-ups, my hands would start tingling. And when putting my ankle on my knee when sitting, it would tingle strongly.

Therefore, feeling stressed or guilty about not being able to continue focusing on a task is counterproductive - use of willpower to keep focused is a patch solution that many times actually depletes even more mental energy. A better solution is to move to another location and take a break by zoning out or otherwise doing nothing.

I find that more difficult or \u0026ldquo;stressful\u0026rdquo; problems can more fully engage me, leading to a personal response than more than compensates for the increased difficulty. Listening to energetic music, or working with others around are good examples of this. Standing desks might also have a similar effect. People who watch TV/videos/streams when working may also be tapping into this effect.\nSee the book \u0026ldquo;Antifragile\u0026rdquo; for more on this, specifically Book 1 Chapter 2.\nFood Personally, eating - especially being full - can derail my ability to be in a productive, flow state. Given this, I try to adhere to this eating schedule to minimize the time I spend full when I want to be productive:\n Meal 1: After waking up and completing one work \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo;. Meal 2: After finishing work and completing one personal \u0026ldquo;sprint\u0026rdquo;.  For both cases, I should delay the meal as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t feel hungry, and even delay a bit if I do feel hungry, to take advantage of the productivity boost that comes when anticipating food (see \u0026ldquo;Distraction and Friction\u0026rdquo;).\nMy first meal should mostly be fatty/with complex carbs. Eating a high-refined-carb (bread/sugar) meal will likely start a \u0026ldquo;snack train\u0026rdquo; that will make it very hard to focus.\nMotivation See https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/\n"});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/docs/how-to-build-skills/','title':"How to Build Skills",'content':"Look at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24696658 for an example of writing practice.\nAdvice for artistic practice: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtt1ycq2rVI\n"});index.add({'id':20,'href':'/docs/how-to-finance/','title':"How to Finance",'content':" Financial Strategy Stock options  Excellent Reference  Retirement Finance To look at  Option writing as income strategy  "});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/docs/how-to-write/','title':"How to Write",'content':" How to Write Writers Block Try talking to someone (or yourself) about your topic, recording the conversation, then using speech-to-text technology to fill your blank page with a first draft.\nhttps://vasilishynkarenka.com/8questions/\n"});index.add({'id':22,'href':'/docs/idea-sources/','title':"Idea Sources",'content':" Sources of General Ideas Blogs  danluu Paul Graham  "});index.add({'id':23,'href':'/docs/music/','title':"Music",'content':" Music Roughly ordered by current into-ness.\nFlow/Immersive  hubris. jakob God is an Astronaut Night Verses Intervals 65daysofstatic Unprocessed  Pump  Russian Circles Zeal and Ardor  Catchy  Tender Metal Mother Pair of Arrows Neon Trees  Chill/Background  Ratatat El Ten Eleven Glitch Mob Tim Hecker Nick Johnston  "});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/docs/notes-on-notetaking/','title':"Notes on Notetaking",'content':" Notes on Notetaking See - https://tkainrad.dev/posts/managing-my-personal-knowledge-base/ - https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/\nGraph Notetaking Idea Use a set of nodes connected to other notes in a graph (like zettelkasten) to store knowledge. Each note should have:\n Constraints under which the notes info doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply (limitation of a study) Some new knowledge, assuming the constraint References to other notes  In addition, the body of notes should contain guiding essays that string together notes in an easy to understand way. This way the graph of knowledge is approachable, and essays/papers don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about not mentioning things, since they are still notes. Later essays can keep exploring the unguided territory.\nThis system has the benefit of encouraging new essays to form from the body of work, which is always at hand and even partially connected already.\n"});index.add({'id':25,'href':'/docs/personal-user-manual/','title':"Personal User Manual",'content':" Personal User Manual Sleep Wear socks to sleep so that: 1.

This allows you to solve problems that otherwise would be much harder or impossible.  Thinking Above the Code by Leslie Lamport  It is easy to trick yourself that you are thinking rationally when you do not share your thoughts by writing them down or speaking them out loud. If you are serious about solving a problem, write down your thought process!  Things You Should Never Do by Joel Spolsky  Rewriting code is tempting, but can destroy solutions to many micro-problems that are hard to see from the top level.  The Origin of Complexity by Joakim Tengstrand  Complexity arises when systems are not changeable. To make systems more chachangeable, increase their usability and reduce coordination between their pieces.

This is enhanced with more certainty of enemy position, with the most extreme example being a prefire.\nIf you are trapped in a bad angle or in a place where enemies know where you are, try using abilities to escape.\nIf you are pushing a site, try using abilities to cut off bad angles.\nGenerally, moving targets are harder to hit.
