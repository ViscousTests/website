# My Personal Website

Website setup was done using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start) and is hosted using
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It uses the
[hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.  Originally, it was
started by copying the example project in the hugo-book repository, and
modifying the pages.  

## Embedding Google Photo

[This website](https://www.labnol.org/embed/google/photos/) makes it easy to
embed Google Photos in my pages so I don't have to host the images myself when
it's less convenient to do so.

## Updating via Android

I had a terrible time getting this set up.  

MGit failed in so many cryptic ways when trying to clone the repository.  

ACode seemed to work, but would squash my remote changes.

GitSync + Markor seems to be the best option so far.

## Dependencies

 - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
 - `sudo apt install hugo`
 - `npm install staticrypt`
 - https://github.com/candid82/joker/releases

## Updating

To update projects hosted on the site:

```
git submodule update --recursive --remote
```

When doing this, try not to update the hugo-book repo, as some new changes break my site.  You can revert changes here via:

```
cd themes/hugo-book
git checkout d86d5e7
cd ../../
git add themes/hugo-book
```

**Make sure you clear your browser cache after updating to see the new code!**

**And make sure that the projects you have updated have been "deployed" (they
have built javascript in a directory in their repositories).
Usually there is a script in each project that does this.**

## Encrypted Pages

To add encrypted pages:

1. Make sure your encrypted data is in a private git repository that is added as
   a submodule of this repository.
2. Make a symlink like `ln submodule/path/to/your/file.md
   content/docs/.../file.md`.
3. Add a line to `deploy.bash` that encrypts your file.
4. For now, add a line to the `is-symlink?` function in `create-index.joke` that
   identifies your file.
5. Supply your desired password whenever running `deploy.bash`.

## Development

Run server locally when writing with:

```
hugo server --disableBrowserError --disableFastRender --poll 1000
```

The poll option is necessary to detect changes to files link to with symlinks.

## Analytics

See analytics at https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report-home/a184778596w255183429p234174405

I added Google Analytics to the site via the `googleAnalytics` field in the
`config.yaml` file - the hugo-book theme handles the rest.
I also needed to make a Google Analytics account with a "Universal Analytics"
property as described at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10269537.
Hugo doesn't seem to support the newer "Measurement ID" created when making a
standard analytics property.

## Adding Images

Sometimes images will not show up (you will get a 404 error) if you do not add
an `index.md` file to the directory containing the image.

This is a hugo quirk.

## Alternatives

 - https://prose.sh/
 - https://neocities.org/

## Inspiration

  - TODO use https://markmap.js.org/ for tables of contents.
  - https://wiki.c2.com/, especially the hover-links-to-see-page feature, which
    I added to this website.
