# Generative Art

## Inspiration

I was originally inspired to work on generative art after viewing this blog:
https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/. I find it fun to try to imagine how each of
these gifs were generated - each one is like a visual puzzle.

An even older project can be found at
https://github.com/kovasap/perspective_words. This project was made while doing
molecular simulation research, and arranges virtual atoms so that they spell
out works when looked at from certain angles.
