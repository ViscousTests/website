# How to Feel Good

## Satisfaction

Happiness is an emotion.  I

Emotions are reactions to changes in perception of environment.
Therefore, to spark happiness, you must see your environment as better than it
was before somehow.  


## Fulfillment


## Inter-societal support

One way to look at people's path through life is with the following gradient:

On one extreme, people start life with a blank slate of skills/interests
and can choose what skills to hone or interests to pursue.

On the other, people's potential skills and interests are either pre-baked into
them or life is set up such that they have no control over what skills and
interests they will ultimately have.

In the first case, people have agency over how much value they contribute to
society and also how much value they capture for themselves.  
In the second, people do not, and therefore it may be right for those richer
than them to support them financially or with other resources.
