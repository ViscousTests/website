# How to Feel Good

## Satisfaction

Happiness is an emotion.  I

Emotions are reactions to changes in perception of environment.
Therefore, to spark happiness, you must see your environment as better than it
was before somehow.  


## Fulfillment


## Inter-societal support

One way to look at people's path through life is with the following gradient:

On one extreme, people start life with a blank slate of skills/interests
and can choose what skills to hone or interests to pursue.

On the other, people's potential skills and interests are either pre-baked into
them or life is set up such that they have no control over what skills and
interests they will ultimately have.

In the first case, people have agency over how much value they contribute to
society and also how much value they capture for themselves.  
In the second, people do not, and therefore it may be right for those richer
than them to support them financially or with other resources.


# The Human Mind

## Frames of Mind

### Flow (State of Doing)

A flow state occurs in the presence of a continuous stream of decisions
that can be made quickly.
Either this is because the decisions have clearly correct choices,
or because their choices are made "correct" by running with assumptions
(strong unsupported opinions).

Can also be though of as a "writing" or "professing" state,
where your current mental state is being pushed out onto some medium.

Thinking about a mind like a tree of many branching connections,
flow means continually following connections,
going "down the rabbit hole" until the state of mind ends or tempers.  

Flow allows for the reinforcing of new connections that were originally
discovered in a mindful state.

In the extreme, flow can be animalistic and stubborn.  

### Mindful (State of Observing)

Opposite to flow, a state of mindfulness occurs when making few/no assumptions
about the world.
In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually questions,
expanding the problem space without looking at it's details.
This state of mind can be paralyzing,
as it lays bare the overwhelming complexity of everything as you continue to
zoom out.
However, it also leads to interesting connections that you may not see in flow.

Can also be thought of as a "reading" or "learning" or "reflecting" state,
where new mental connections are being created actively.  

In the mind-tree analogy, mindfulness means seeing all the branches of the tree,
but not diving down any particular route.  
Instead, it means continually looking for new starting points.

Mindfulness can discover new connections that can then be reinforced through
flow.

Extreme mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless theorizing
that is too far removed from reality to be useful. 

### The Edge

For learning new things, riding the edge between mindfulness and flow is
extremely helpful.  This can manifest as making assumptions mindfully and
testing them through flow.  


## Mind as Multiple Actors

I find a useful way to think about my mind is as a congress of many (simple-ish)
actors.


## Learning

Learning is a process during which neurons in a human brain rearrange to store
patterns either taken in by the senses, or observed in the brain itself.
This process requires either change of existing patterns, or accretion of new
ones.

The human brain constantly absorbs new information from its perspective on the
environment where it is.
For learning therefore, it is very important to place oneself in an environment
conducive to learning what you want to learn.

## "Intelligence"

Informed by:
 - WASL/SAT/GRE tests I've taken
 - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/g-miseducation-larry-p

In my opinion, intelligence as a concept is a harmful oversimplification.  My
thoughts on several contexts in which the word is used are described here:

### Ability to Learn


Tests judging intelligence, or general mental ability, are used to decide
whether students at all levels are capable of participating in certain
educational activities.  
These activities include taking certain courses and being admitted into certain
programs or schools.


### Social Perception

People use intelligence to describe each other in a general way.
