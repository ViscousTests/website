# Random Ideas

A collection of random short ideas I've had over the years that I haven't
executed on (yet). If you find or do one of these things let me know!


## Programming

### Make $1 on the Internet

Will probably lead to an interesting journey!

### "System 1" Chatbot

A chatbot that simulates talking to the "system 1" part of the brain only as
described in "Thinking, Fast and Slow".

### Album Cover Quiz Site

Given an album cover (or movie cover or book cover), try to guess its genre or
other things about it.  Basically [this](http://playjudgey.com/).  

### Money Conversion App/Site

An app that allows the user to compare current market values of different
things.  For example, avocados to dollars or hours of specific work to rocks
etc.  Would be cool to have a web page associated that points out interesting
comparisons.  

### String Image Formatter

Write a program that takes in a string and an image file, then adds
newlines/spaces/formatting to the string so that it looks like the image when
viewed from a distance.  If the string is too short to work, repeat it or
somehow compress the image so it works out perfectly.  

### Synonym Finder

A program (or text editor plugin) where you can search text using all synonyms
of the words you typed to search.  For example, searching some documentation for
"log" would search for the word "log", but also (and with lower priority) the
words "stderr", "stdout", "output", etc.  This could also just be build in to
the search bar, where a window would pop up containing reframings of what you
searched for, as suggestions for what else to try.  

### See Through Walls with VR/AR

Try to (using google maps or pre-collected data) model an object in the real
world at its exact real world position in a VR or AR simulation.  For example,
model a toothbrush in a bathroom so that when using VR in the living room you
can "see through walls" to see exactly the toothbrush.  Could be used to show
large objects around the world at their exact positions (like the Eiffel tower
or Mt Everest).  This would have a cool effect of giving you a really good
bearing on your location with respect to the rest of the world.  

### Word Traversal Game

Make a word game where you try to get from one word to another via connections
such as:

 - Words used in the same sentence of a given book
 - Synonyms/Antonyms

https://www.word.golf/ is pretty close to this. It would be cool if it could be
extended to other ways of connecting words.

### Open Twitter

A social network that just provides a raw database of tweets or posts and lets
many third party sites pop up that censor/curate/organize the posts/tweets in
different ways.

### Memorization Game Mod

Mod a game you play often (e.g. Skyrim) so that random quips (e.g. "arrow to
the knee") are replaced by random facts you want to memorize.


## Lifestyle Optimization

### Water Saving Toilet

Make a toilet where urine is redirected (like a composting toilet) into a
separate area with no water in it (the back of the toilet still has water).
Then, when you pee in that area you don't need to flush, but when you poop (or
otherwise flush), the rising water will drain into the pee area as well,
washing it.  This should reduce the number of flushes per day by a lot for the
average toilet.

### "Feeling" Biomarkers

Try hooking up a continuous glucose (or other biomarker) monitor up to a
vibration arm band (as discussed in the book "Livewired" by David Eagleman) to
"feel" blood glucose concentration.

### Hot Water Towel Rack

Extend the hot water pipe that feeds a shower outside of the wall in a towel
rack shape.
This will let the water flowing through the pipe heat your towel so it's nice
and warm when you go to dry off.

### Upside Down Keyboard

Put your keyboard and mouse underneath your desk and use them with your palms
facing up.
This might help with RSI or at least would be a funny joke to surprise coworkers
with.


## Amusing

### Musical Toothbrush

A vibrating toothbrush that can accept a midi or other audio file. Then it will
modulate the vibrations to the tune of the audio.

### Random Ice Prank

Put [two liquids that
freeze](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.8b00239) (or get cold)
when mixed in a laundry machine, surprising whoever goes to transfer their
clothes!

### Reverse Car Wash

Instead of (or in addition to) spinning the bristles in a car wash, spin the
car instead!
More specifically, move the car around quickly like an amusement park ride so 
that it rubs against the bristles.


## Data Exploration

### Ambiguous Acronyms

Make a survey with ambiguous acronyms and see how the results differ based on
the community that's being asked (e.g. AC could be Armor Class or Air
Conditioning). This could be done on subreddits.

### Regular Break Lifelogging

Every 30 minutes get up, walk around, and quickly note down what the last 30
minutes was spent doing. Then use that data for cool visualizations.

### Tracking Digestion with Center of Mass

Use body's center of mass to estimate digestion progress/state.  Presumably
right after eating mass is centered in the stomach, then slowly diffuses to
other parts of the body


## Food

### Bell Pepper Cup

Cut the top off of a bell pepper and use it as a cup.  

### Popped Potatoes

Pop potatoes like corn by wrapping them in a hard shell and cooking them.

### Refried Bean Pizza

Put refried beans on pizza.

### Selling Chip Dust

Companies should sell the flavoring blends that flavor potato chips.


## Cultural

### Day of Music

A holiday where everyone in their own homes/neighborhoods plays along to a
single song in whatever way they can.

### 1000 Hour Tattoos

Everybody has a list of activities that they've done for a thousand hours or
more.
It would be cool if people had a piece of jewelry with removable parts like a
necklace with beads, and each activity that they've done for over a thousand
hours would be represented by one bead.
You could also do this with a tattoo where you have different parts of a pattern
interlinking, with each part representing an activity.

I think this would be a cool way to start conversations and also show people
that people spend a lot of time doing things that you may not expect just by
looking at them.
Especially things that are mindless or relaxing; everybody would have a bead for
sleeping but people might also have beads for zoning out.
I think visualizing this is a good way of normalizing the fact that everybody
needs that kind of time.
And that that kind of time isn't an impediment to success, because many people
that you may aspire to be like may have beads like that, which shows that
they're more human than you might think.


## Artistic

### Monthly Clock Garden

Make a circular (or square) yard with 12 plants that each bloom during each
month of the year.

### Mood Ring Contacts

Contact for you eyes that change their color based on your mood.  For example,
red eyes could signify anger, black eyes depressions, blue eyes calm, green
eyes joy, etc.

### Encoding Vocal Inflection in Text

In March 2022 I started using text to speech converters to generate audiobooks
for me to listen to on commutes. The biggest difference I noticed between robot
audio and a human reading out loud is that spacing between words and vocal
inflections don't always happen in the same way. For instance, a robot voice
may not give weight to a sentence that a human would.

It would be neat if an author could somehow encode this vocal inflection in
their text (by using bold/italics or special characters) in such a way that a
text to speech encoder could react to, to generate more natural sounding audio.

Poets (or artistic authors) could even hijack this system to instead add
bizarre inflection to their text such that it would sound strange when
text-to-speechified. I imagine you could do some pretty wild stuff here, from
creating novel accents to spicing up rhyming verses. This technique would also
allow you to encode sounds in writing that are impossible for a human voice to
make.

### Laser Cut Leaves

Etch some cool pattern in tough, large leaves (treating them like paper).

### Laser Cut Flip Book

#### Main Idea

Create a flip book by laser engraving a stack of thin wood (or thick paper)
pieces, each with one frame of a gif or short video.  Then, create a box that
the stack can fit into snugly, with one of the walls perpendicular to the stack
removed.  In the place of that wall, put a mobile rod (or just make the wall
removable).  If you then turn the box so that the rod or movable wall is facing
the ground, you can remove the wall and let the pieces fall downward, advancing
the frame and animating the gif/video.

#### Variation

Make the stack of frames, then drill a hole in one corner and thread a rod
through the stack.  You should be able to then rotate the stack around like a
spiral staircase.  Maybe you can animate it like this?

### Table Fountain

If you have a round table to eat at that seats ~4 people, put a symmetrical
fountain like those found in gardens in the middle for people to use to refill
their water cups.  Could have four streams for easier filling.
