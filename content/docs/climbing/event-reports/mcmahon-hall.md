# Climbing McMahon - 2014

After thinking about it and testing out the movements going down and up a
floor, I climbing from my unit's balcony on the 7th floor in the McMahon dorms
to the top floor (11?).  Mostly this felt quite safe; there was just one
section of three stacked balconies that required stepping out over some
exposure (3 floors to the balcony that would catch me).  This section required
going to a balcony right above the current one, making me step onto the
railing, doing a bit of an undercling on the bottom on the upper balcony, and
reaching out to grab the steel railing above.  Then pulling myself up was easy.

This experience made me feel powerful and capable, even though it was probably
in the 5.8 range of difficulty - made a bit easier given my height.  It was
also cool to surprise some people hanging out on their own balconies : ).
