# Namaste Wall - Zion National Park

Done on October 7th, 2019.

I heard originally of this wall from lots of beautiful Reddit posts on
r/climbing. Claire and I took a trip to the area together and took the
opportunity to visit the place for ourselves.

The rock was absolutely incredible, forming many shapes I've never climbed on
before. Most features were easy to grab, which was good, as the wall was quite
overhanging and the sandy rock meant it was a bit tricky to get a firm grip.

One close mishap we had was the first climb I tried with Claire as my belay.
The large overhang made her swing more that we anticipated into a nearby rock
when I uncliped my first quickdraw from the wall (after getting lowered).
Luckily she wasn't hurt, but it was a good lesson to be very sure about rope
geometry before unclipping!

We were extremely luckly to run into a pair of Canadian guys with a nice camera
that were also climbing at Namaste at the same time. In exchange for me taking
pictures of them, we traded belays, which let me try several more routes than I
would have otherwise with just Claire as my belay.
