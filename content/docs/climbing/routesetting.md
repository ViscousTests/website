## 8/10/2025

2 routes on "two crack" rope 13.  

 - Purple:
   - Exaggeratedly long start traverse that people could boulder.
     Found some good crimps deep in upper roof crack.
 - Green:
   - Thin, with double baby heads facing each other on underside of upper roof.

## 7/12/2025

2 routes on long overhanging pillar.

 - Brown:
   - Lots of foot hand matching.
     Hard gaston to large knob hold at roof, then thin holds to finish.
     Fun to watch people lead!
 - Black:
   - Soo many hoolds!
     Used everything even though I brought up a lot.
     Felt mediocre.

## 6/28/2025

3 routes right by window.  Needed to toe hook window to get over enough to put some holds in!

 - Red:
   - Blood holds, exploring fun rightmost side of wall that is usually empty
 - Grey:
   - Fin pinch holds, barn door inducing.
     A hold near the top broke while someone was trying to climb it!
 - Brown:
   - Sidepull jugs, more of a warmup.

2 routes on rope 22 next to bouldering wall.

 - Yellow "comPRESS me":
  - Cool start with big mantle move to sloping hold.
    Then some diabolical compression climbing on the corner which I'm not sure
    is even possible.
 - Black "dark growth":
  - Fun growth like holds that flowed well for me.
    May be a bit reachy, especially at the top :/.

Boulder setting.
Especially proud of a yellow route with big rectangular holds where you start
with your back to the wall.

## 4/6/2025

2 routes on "two crack" rope 13.  

 - Grey "imPRESS me":
  - Very proud of this one.
    Cool press moves, and interesting roof manuvering

 - Red:
  - Less good, tried to make easy but still ended up 5.10.
    Roof area was particularly awkward.
    Big holds do not make for an easy fun time when there are no feet.

## Rain city send 2/2025

Very happy with the "crawling out of a hole" vibe this black one I set gave off:
