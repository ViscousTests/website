# Gym Sends

Climbs I'm proud of doing at gyms.

## Orange 5.12

Really interesting climb with a lot of horizontal movement.
Especially proud of very large dyno towards the top.

## Black 5.12+ "Darkrai"

Spent a long time on this one, with the crux being a very balancy and precise
left hand gaston sidepull to a really bad right hand sloping crimp.
The angle of my flagging right foot was critical to do it!
