# Little Si - Exit 32

## World Wall

Left to right.

### Dairy Freeze - 5.12b

### Bust a Move - 5.12a

#### Beta

For "the move", I need to gaston undercling left hand above rest crimp, get my
feet up, then throw strait for the right hand undercling/sidepull.
From there I should be able to continue getting my feet up to throw for the next
good holds.

### Spent - 5.11b

Sent!
Very long on mostly good holds, but still a test of endurance towards the top.
Crux section in the middle much harder than everything else and perplexing.
Luckily you can stem before/after to rest and think.

### Rainy Day Woman - 5.12a

Done on lead on 9/8/2025!
Super intense crux clip.
I think I got my right foot too high, and was barn dooring off the right hand
hold and foot as I clipped.
Managed to keep it together then very slowly finished the route, resting a lot
on the good final holds.
Didn't really feel that exciting at the end; I didn't feel like I really
mastered the route.

#### Beta

Key is to recover effectively at rests.
At the upper roof I need to not be scared and get my feet up constantly,
"perching" on the holds.  Meanwhile with my hands:

 - Left hand on crimp above roof
 - Right on lower stair step
 - Left hand on upper stair step
 - Reach right across to clipping sidepull

Then foot up on crimp above roof, then onto stairsteps.

## World Wall 2

### Orgasmatron - 5.12a

Very cool endurance route.

First time up I didn't make it all the way to the anchor and my partner decided
to TR it with extreme swing potential.
Then after we were done we tried to set up a TR on renaissance, and I got too
far away from the wall, subjecting my partner to _another_ "swing-y" TR session.

### Renaissance - 5.12b

Sooo hard.
Pockets are better than they appear, but I still had to usually crimp the
outside of them, then readjust to get my fingers in deeper.

## Other

### Lay of the Land - 5.12a

My first 5.12 on lead!

Very easy start that is a good warm up, then just gets harder until the top.

#### Beta

Important to go far right at the two draws on the right side of the corner; better holds over there.

After turning the corner is the crux.
I found later that the easiest way to do the crux is actually to lieback the
corner and smear my feet on nothing, then reach up for the good rail.
This felt better than putting my foot on the crux foolhold and going up from
there.
At least that move is very low percentage for me.
