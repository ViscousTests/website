# Crag of the 20s

## Quadratic Cave

### Orthogonal Projection - 5.11b

Extremely cool route.
Haven't yet figured out how to get out of the cave with the hanging chain clip.

### Urination Equation - 5.12c/d

Surprisingly close on TR, need to go back for this one.

## Waterfall Wall

### Concentrated Moisture - 5.12-

Worked with Jakob helping finish what another party started.

Jakob had a very harrowing lead:

 - Dropping a quickdraw which bounced into the woods when trying to unclip it
   from an unnecessary bolt.
 - Blowing a clip while I was trying to detangle the rope from a stick clip,
   leading to me getting pulled through a handrail fixed line and him taking a
   big (luckily safe) fall.
 - Extremely tense final chain clip.
   Honestly this is kinda the crux of the route.
   Not much to work with when mantling over the final ledge.
