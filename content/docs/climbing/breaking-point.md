# Physical "Breaking Point"

One interesting thing I've noticed about myself as I progress through a
climbing session is that my ability degradation due to tiredness is not linear,
or really consistent at all.  There are some days where I can crush hard route
after hard route, and it feels like each new hard ascent makes me feel **more**
energized than I was before.  Then on some days, if I fall on a route early,
the rest of the session will be a struggle.

I think this is because falling involves a last extreme effort from my body
right before the actual fall that leads to a long lasting fatigue. This puts a
particular strain on me that climbing many difficult routes without falling
does not.
