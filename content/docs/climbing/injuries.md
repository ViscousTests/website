## Climbers Elbow

For 2+ years I suffered from a mild, or at least easily avoided, inner elbow pain that I found very hard to accurately define.  Eventually, I learned that it was likely climber's elbow.  

After learning this, it still took me some trial and error to address it properly.  I tried several exercises:

 - Dumbbell eccentric wrist extensions
   - These were time consuming to do and it was hard for me to notice them
     working my forearm or having any other real effect.
 - [Hammer
   rotations](https://trainingforclimbing.com/treating-climbers-elbow-medial-epicondylitis/)
   - These felt effective, but only at high weight.
     Unfortunately, at high weight my left wrist also really started to hurt,
     making these not very viable to fix my problem.
 - **Eccentric bicep curls (barbell or resistance bands)**
   - These are awesome!
     Very easy to do in a way that works my muscle, and seem to have a strong
     effect towards reducing my elbow pain.
     Plus they make my arms look strong while I am doing them :).
