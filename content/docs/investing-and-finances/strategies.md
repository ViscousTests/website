## Inflation Indexed Bonds

In 2022, inflation was pretty high, as described by
[Kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/economic-forecasts/inflation):

> In July’s price report, falling prices at the gas pump gave consumers a bit
> of relief, as well as lowering the overall inflation rate to 8.5% from 9.1% in
> June.
> A few other price categories showed easing: Appliance prices are coming down,
> along with sporting goods, men’s clothing, car rentals and hotel rates.
> Airfares dropped because of lower fuel costs, and used-car prices edged down.
> All of these were enough to bring down non-energy, non-food price increases to a
> moderate level in July.

This led to a very high rate of almost 10% for [Series I Savings
Bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm#change).
This is amazing for a bond and seems like a no-brainer buy.
However, there are some caveats:

1. The bond cannot be sold for 1 year.
1. If sold before 5 years, you lose the last 3 months of interest.
1. You must pay income tax on earnings when the bonds are sold.
1. The rate is reindexed to inflation every 6 months, so this return will only
   come as long as inflation is high.

Kiplinger again:

> Inflation is not done yet.
> Prices continued to rise strongly for basics such as food, rent and new
> vehicles.
> There is some evidence that food prices may be moderating after a year’s worth
> of large monthly increases.
> But continuing large wage increases at many businesses are likely to keep upward
> pressure on most prices for some time to come.
> Expect price inflation at the end of the year to be around 8.0%, down a bit from
> the peak of 9.1% in June, but still high.
> Inflation will likely fall to around 3%-4% by the end of next year if the
> economy slows, as expected.

From the [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/price/inflation-forecast.htm):

So it looks like if I buy these bonds now I will probably get a year out of them
before I will want to go back into the stock market.
With income tax on earnings plus the 3 month interest payback, I'm likely
looking at a return of 9.6% for 6 months, then 7% for 6 months, then 0% for 3
months (because I lose the last 3 months), or 6.64% interest.
After a ~35% tax (I expect to sell the rest of my investments only when my
income and therefore tax rate is much lower), this ends up being **4.32%**.

This is much better than the 0% rate I am getting on the $5-10k I keep in my
bank account (I know, I live dangerously...), but at the cost of liquidity,
especially for the first year.
It's not really an emergency fund if you can't withdraw it.

I'm not convinced that this rate will beat the stock market overall in the next
year though.

So if I'm not using the bonds as an emergency fund, it comes down to: do I think
that the market will grow less than ~4.5% in the next year?
For me the answer is no right now.

## The Value Factor

Investment returns can theoretically be explained by different factors
[described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4).  Total market
index funds do not expose you fully to the value factor, which might be useful
to do for maximizing returns in the long run.  Here are some first steps to do
this (that I have yet to follow):

## Leverage

Using leverage (taking loans to buy investments) can be a power way to "time
diversify", as explained in [this Ben Felix
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll3TCEz4g1k).

**Using loans to make big purchases is generally worth it if you invested in
stocks that have a long term expected return higher than the loan rate (which
is usually true).**

## The "Barbell" Strategy

In his books Nassim Taleb describes a strategy where 90% of the portfolio is in
a very safe asset like treasury bills and 10% is in very risky investments like
risky stock options or early stage startups.
It would be cool to see how some concrete instances of this would perform on
historical data (with some random way to pick the 10% to avoid hindsight bias).

Note that Taleb himself seems to think that a better plan for retirement is
(small) business ownership:
