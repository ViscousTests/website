## The Value Factor

Investment returns can theoretically be explained by different factors
[described here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTnIebSzj4).  Total market
index funds do not expose you fully to the value factor, which might be useful
to do for maximizing returns in the long run.  Here are some first steps to do

## The "Barbell" Strategy

In his books Nassim Taleb describes a strategy where 90% of the portfolio is in
a very safe asset like treasury bills and 10% is in very risky investments like
risky stock options or early stage startups.
It would be cool to see how some concrete instances of this would perform on
historical data (with some random way to pick the 10% to avoid hindsight bias).
