# Financial Independence

## What?

Accumulating enough assets such that the passive income generated from them
exceeds your cost of living.  A rough estimate often used is the "4% rule": it
states that you should expect your assets to generate 4% of their value in
income every year. This means if you have $1 million in assets, you should
expect at least $40k a year in income from those assets.

## Why?

So you can pursue what you find is most valuable in life. Some projects that FI
has enabled:
