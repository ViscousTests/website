# Investing and Finance Influences

These books/blogs/podcasts/people have most shaped how I understand finances.

## [Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDXTQ8nWmx_EhZ2v-kp7QxA)

Runs a great YouTube channel (and podcast) about investing concepts.

## [Early Retirement Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/)

The ERE book and the blog's most popular posts are an excellent view into a
strongly coherent and appealing life philosophy. Highly, highly recommend.

## [Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)

My first introduction to the idea of financial independance. I haven't read a lot of the articles, but the ones I did read were very influential.

## The [Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com/)

Great mechanical guide for how to become financially independant. I used to
listen to the podcast a lot on my commutes. [This article about the author's portfolio](https://www.madfientist.com/my-portfolio/) is a good example of the content.

## The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

Not the most influential book I've read, but does a good job summarizing the
thoughts of others. Often when reading I remembered some advice I had
previously heard but forgotten.

## [Antifragile by Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)
