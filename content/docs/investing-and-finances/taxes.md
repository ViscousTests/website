# Taxes

## Selling Stock

Selling stock at a gain is a taxable event. If you've held the stock for < 1
year, it is taxed as ordinary income; otherwise it is taxed at a lower capital
gains rate. [This Motley Fool
page](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/selling-stock-taxes/)
has a good explanation with examples. 

Note that your capital gains themselves help determine your capital gains tax
rate. If you make no ordinary income, but sell stock resulting in a $1 million
gain, your income for the purposes of determining your capital gains tax rate
will be $1 million. You will **not** pay ordinary income tax on this amount,
but instead the 20% (in 2021) capital gains tax rate for this income level.

If you are making
[significant](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc/large-gains-lump-sum-distributions-etc)
capital gains over the year and are not offsetting this amount by for example
having your employer withhold more tax, you must pay taxes quarterly to the IRS
[here](https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay). If you do not, you may need to
pay an underpayment pentalty when it comes time to file your tax return.

## Optimizing Capital Gains When Retired

If you are retired and need < ~$40k per year to live (in 2021), you could
survive by selling < ~$40k of stock per year (which should definitely have <
~$40k of capital gains) and pay 0% capital gains tax.

## Tax Loss Harvesting

Good descriptions:

1. Sell your losing investment.
1. Buy another (intermediate) investment that you are happy holding.
1. If you want, sell your intermediate investment and buy back your original
   >30 days after the original sale.
   - **Make sure that your intermediate investment hasn't gone up in value when
     you do this, otherwise you will cancel out your losses!**

Probably a good strategy is to, when the market is falling, set a reminder to
sell all losing shares and buy a similar investment twice a week.  This way you
will be sure to get the maximum losses and won't miss the bottom.
