# Personal Portfolio Thoughts

Historically 100% VTSAX due to long time horizon and simplicity.

Recently I have become convinced that more global diversification and factor weighting would be smart.
Media that has done this:

 - [Ben Felix Portfolio](https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-Factor-Investing-with-ETFs.pdf)
 - [Optimized Portfolio summary of Ben Felix portfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ben-felix-model-portfolio/)

[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/194MljSwYb0xPcHhG7sznh0LJ2a-2YejxfP0fVGVV2Jw/edit#gid=0) a scratchpad of me trying to implement this.

A step in this direction would be:
 - 22% total international
 - 8% small cap value international
 - 12% small cap value US
 - 58% vtsax

Looking at "growth of $10,000" charts is kinda misleading, because the end result can vary greatly based on when you start.
Rolling or yearly return charts are better I think.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DEl9ddc2U0Ycc-hWV2PrWsrrcuVH7J8gtCL2c1D1UaA/edit#gid=0) is a yearly return chart comparing vtsax with the Ben Felix portfolio.

My current decision is to just stick to VTSAX unless it starts underperforming for over a year.
Then I may switch to something like the Ben Felix portfolio.
It's hard for me to do otherwise seeing as the US market has outperformed the ex-US index for the last 10 years:
