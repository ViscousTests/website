# Game Ideas

## Farming Game

Into the breach like isometric map.
Turn based XCOM like combat.
Medieval fantasy theme.
Two phases:
 1. Plant crops in land
 2. Defend crops/house from weather or raiders
      - raiders
      - insects eating crops
      - snowstorm
      - 
Crops let you make food, which gives you:
 1. Ability to make more family members to help do stuff
 2. Buffs for combat
 3. All materials you need to upgrade
Game has visible timeline (which you can extend with plant buffs) to see what
events you will have to contend with in the future.

Game consists of different environments to "master".  An environment is mastered
when all events can be dealt with easily for a certain time.
