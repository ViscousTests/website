# Watching The Matrix

Watched with my Dad after being told that it would be very hard to understand. Turned out that wasn't true for either of us. Excellent sci-fi, where sci-fi is defined as a medium that explores how new plausible technologies would affect the world. Action/style was very compelling to. Favorite movie for many years, perhaps even still in some ways. I think the sequels are pretty good, unlike many others.
