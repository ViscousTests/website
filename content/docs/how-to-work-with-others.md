# How to Work With Others

Everyone you are working with will have a model in their heads that describes
their best solution to the problem at hand.  Everyone involved must take their
models out of their heads so that others can amend their own models in an
effort to reach some kind of consensus.  This is hard work and is not always
treated as such.

## Complaining

People complain for at least two main reasons:

1. They need help with something.  Either via:
    1. Direct help (offloading their problem in part to someone else).
    1. Advice help (having another person help improve their understanding of
       their problem, so that they can solve it alone without transferring any
       responsibility).
    1. In "How to Change your Mind" by Michael Pollan this was described as a
       "doing" behavior.
1. They want to share their feelings so that others around them are on the same
   page about their emotional state.  This is helpful e.g. so others around
   them will not burden them further, unaware of their current burden.  This is
   also helpful for emotional validation reasons - it is useful to know if the
   thing you are upset about upsets others; if not, perhaps you are missing an
   easy resolution to your problem.
    1. In "How to Change your Mind" by Michael Pollan this was described as a
       "being" (in the moment) behavior.

It is easy (at least for me) to jump strait to advice help when people complain
around me and ignore the fact that the complainer may need one of the other
types of resolution described above.
