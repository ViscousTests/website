# Design via Documentation

One trap that I've fallen into early on in a project is a lack of "concreteness"
about what the final proposed product will look like.
Design documents should solve this problem, but are often written in a more
abstract tone, or have holes of vagueness in them that are hard to find at time
of writing.
The main issue with this is that two people reading the same design can come to
different conclusions, or no one will spot a big problem.

Additionally, design documents can be hard to write when there are so many
unknowns at the outset of a project.
Prototyping before design can help with this, but is not perfect.

An alternate step to take before design (or instead of design), is to write
guided documentation for the final product as if it existed.
This documentation would walk though the critical user journeys of the proposed
product, going into more implementation detail than a normal documentation page.

By walking through all the steps like this, it is much more concrete what the
user experience will be like, and holes or unknowns will be easier to spot.
Additionally, feedback can be much more precise and specific; reviewers can
point to a specific step in the user journey and express skepticism or propose
an additional step.
