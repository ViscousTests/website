## Influences

- [Getting things done by Johnathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCzrKjbXZQY)
  - Depth first approach to problem solving can be bad because you end up going
    in the wrong direction (which you would have avoided going breath-first)
- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
  - Stepping back from a problem and doing other things or sleeping allows
    unconscious parts of your mind draw connections that you otherwise wouldn't
    draw.  This allows you to solve problems that otherwise would be much harder
    or impossible.
- [Thinking Above the Code by Leslie Lamport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q)
  - It is easy to trick yourself that you are thinking rationally when you do
    not share your thoughts by writing them down or speaking them out loud.  If
    you are serious about solving a problem, write down your thought process!
- [Things You Should Never Do by Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)
  - Rewriting code is tempting, but can destroy solutions to many
    micro-problems that are hard to see from the top level.
- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)
  - A good reality check on being practical when programming, and being honest
    with oneself about how things are actually working.
 - [Cognitive load is what matters](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42489645)
   - A framework for thinking about what organizational systems to adopt in your code.
