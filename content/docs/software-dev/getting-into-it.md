# Getting Into It

The hardest part of many programming endeavors (or creative projects in general)
is "getting into it".
This is the initial stage of the project where you are loading in the context
required to fix your bug, add your feature, etc.

The difficulty comes mostly from ambiguity: not knowing what actions to take to
make progress.
Usually, ambiguity in these cases leads to lots of "wasted" time trying things
that don't work or otherwise stumbling around blindly.
Not only is this a loss of time, but it can kill motivation too; it's hard to
motivate doing something that you are pretty sure will lead nowhere.
Loss of motivation here can lead to project abandonment, or more often "waiting
work"; waiting for answers to questions posted online or inspiration to strike.

## Strategies

One thing that has helped me with this problem is spending time reading about
the issue.
Reading is nice is that it is very unambiguous what to do; you just read the
words.
Even if you are reading the wrong thing initially, the process of reading often
helps lead to the right place.
At the very least it lets your subconscious work on the problem as it tries to
map what you are reading onto the problem.
