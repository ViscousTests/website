## Angle Pushing

In a scenario with two people fighting around a corner, the person further from
the corner should have an advantage - they will be able to see their opponent
slightly earlier.  

The person peeking should also have a slight advantage, provided they peek only
one possible enemy location at once.  This is enhanced with more certainty of
enemy position, with the most extreme example being a prefire.

If you are trapped in a bad angle or in a place where enemies know where you
are, try using abilities to escape.

If you are pushing a site, try using abilities to cut off bad angles.
