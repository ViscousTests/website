## Attainment

I am motivated by attainment.  My mind/body strive to attain:

 - security (state of knowing my basic needs are at hand)
 - understanding
 - efficiency for myself
 - efficiency for others

Be wary of attempting to attain the unattainable.  Grand truths and unifying
philosophies are tempting goals, but can lead to extreme frustration or, worse,
acceptance of a false conclusion just to reach attainment.


## Self-sufficiency

I want my life to be full of good emotions.  I feel good emotions when I attain
something I find important.  This could be:

 - understanding that makes life easier
 - giving understanding successfully to someone to make their life easier
 - a resource that I need to survive (food, water, money)
 - comfort
 - an ability/performance that I don't always have

The attainment of these things comes most reliably from myself.  I am very
confident in my ability to attain stuff, or at least to work out how to attain
it.  Relying on others to help me attain things I find important (that they
might not) is usually less reliable that just doing it myself.  

Usually involving others in my life is an augmentation to what I currently do.
I feel scared and insecure when I need to depend on others to feel positive
emotions.  I'm ok with people just boosting my emotions, but when they are the
source of an emotion I depend on I become insecure.
