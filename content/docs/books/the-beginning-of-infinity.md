# [_The Beginning of Infinity_ by David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity)

Excellent book that addresses (a theory for) how knowledge is created and the
implications that has for humankind, and "people" more generally. David's
theory is that knowledge is created by filtering many creative conjectures into
those that give the best explanations for things via a tradition of criticism.
