# [_Zero to One_ by Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One)

Book that tries to answer the question of (1) what kinds of work
will have the highest (positive) impact on humanity and (2) how to do that
work.

My short synopsis: _Zero to One_ argues that completely novel ideas that don't
directly compete in any existing markets lead to the most successful businesses
and the most positive change for humanity. Therefore, we should focus our
energy on being different, "thinking for ourselves", and coming up with the
most bold, creative ideas possible as opposed to diversifying our interests and
seeking incremental change.
