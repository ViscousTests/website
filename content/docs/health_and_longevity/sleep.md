# Sleep

Some tips and tricks that work for me to get better sleep.

## Smart Alarm

[Sleep as Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) has a feature where instead
of setting an alarm to go off at 8am, you tell the app to wake you up say
between 7am and 8am.  Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a
lighter sleep phase.  I've found this to be **way** more pleasant than waking
up at a fixed time.  In fact, I've found that I more naturally wake up by
myself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body
associates it with lighter sleep.

This app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.

## Temperature and Airflow

For me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my
sleep quality.  For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and
keeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or
otherwise stimulate my skin.

In practice, I best accomplish this by:

1. Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don't get
   uncomfortably cold.
1. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise "warm-feeling" sheets to that my
   skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to
   fluctuations in air temperature or movement.

## Activities

Playing FPS or other games within and hour or so of sleeping can make it harder
to fall asleep, but may not affect sleep quality after falling asleep.
