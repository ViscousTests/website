# What should I eat?

Mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week[^1].

## Things to avoid

 - Refined sugars
    - [Danger of Fast
       Carbs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/carbs-are-killing-us/609040/)
 - Red meat


# When should I eat?

Probably mostly earlier in the day[^2][^3], and within a 8-12 hour
window[^3][^4].

- [Meal Timing And Frequency Effects on Cardiovascular
  Disease](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476)
  - Eating meals earlier in the day **might** be healthier
  - Eating meals on a regular schedule is likely healthier

Recently I've found eating a small, high fat/fiber meal at ~11am, then eating
the rest of my food after I'm done being productive for the day is good for
focus.


# Should I fast for prolonged periods?

Probably[^1].
