- [Simple made Easy by Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)
  - Complex = entangled = difficult to reason about
  - To make systems more understandable, need to reduce them to small,
    **independant** pieces (like pure functions with no side effects)
- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
  - Stepping back from a problem and doing other things or sleeping allows
    unconscious parts of your mind draw connections that you otherwise wouldn't
    draw.  This allows you to solve problems that otherwise would be much harder
    or impossible.
- [Thinking Above the Code by Leslie Lamport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q)
  - It is easy to trick yourself that you are thinking rationally when you do
    not share your thoughts by writing them down or speaking them out loud.  If
    you are serious about solving a problem, write down your thought process!
- [Things You Should Never Do by Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)
  - Rewriting code is tempting, but can destroy solutions to many
    micro-problems that are hard to see from the top level.
- [The Origin of Complexity by Joakim
  Tengstrand](https://itnext.io/the-origin-of-complexity-8ecb39130fc)
  - Complexity arises when systems are not changeable.  To make systems more
    chachangeable, increase their **usability** and reduce **coordination**
    between their pieces.
