# Judging Art

How can you tell what art is high quality and/or worth consuming?

## Reviews

Good, but can be biased by competing interests.


## Meaning

It would be cool to ask many people to give a ranked list of the 50 most
meaningful experiences in their lives. From this, you could extract art entries
and rank them by their occurrence, which would probably give a good list of
what is worth experiencing yourself.
