# Things to do When Unmotivated

See also my [deeper dive on the nature of motivation]({{< relref
"/docs/mind/motivation.md" >}}).

## Background

Usually I go through a couple periods of time every day where I don't really
feel like doing anything, or I at least don't feel like doing anything
that requires focus. I've noticed this happens for a couple reasons:

 - It's the afternoon (I think because of some circadian rhythm of mine).
 - I ate in the last couple hours.
 - I exercised around an hour or two ago. Right after exercise I usually feel
   quite focused/energized.
 - I feel hot/sweaty/greasy.
 - I've been sitting and staring at a screen (usually doing focus-requiring
   work) for too long (5+ hours).

## Ideas

The ideal task would be something that doesn't require focus, works towards
something useful (e.g. a skill), and inspires motivation after doing it for a
while. Some ideas:

 - Write a narrative of what you have been doing towards a particular task to
   clear up thinking about it.
   - Con: Can be hard
 - Napping.
 - Going for a run or doing any kind of exercise.
 - Taking a shower
 - Not eating (being hungry), or getting colder in temperature.
   - Con: Stressful.  Best if paired with another engaging activity.
 - Organizing stuff.
   E.g.
   going through old browser tabs or loading the dishwasher.
   - Pro: Productive (work that would have to be done anyway).
   - Pro: Can inspire creativity if going through old things that you have
     memories of.
 - Sitting and doing nothing.
   - Pro: Boredom often inspires motivation.
   - Con: Can be uncomfortable.
 - Browsing Reddit or Hacker News.
   - Pro: Can sometimes find really useful information.
   - Pro: Entertaining.
   - Con: Isn't very restful, doesn't do a good job inspiring motivation.
   - Con: Can lead to a time-comsuming rabbit-hole.
 - Listening to energetic music.
   - Pro: Entertaining.
   - Pro: Often inspires focus.
   - Con: Can actually be grating/more tiring sometimes.
   - Con: Sometimes leads to distractions like reading about the artist or
     reading the lyrics.
     This depends highly on the song.
 - Talking to people.
   - Con: People not always available.
   - Con: Can be draining.
   - Con: Can lock you in to a conversation longer than you want to be.
 - Eating.
   - Pro: Is relaxing.
   - Con: Can lead to "snack-train"-ing, where I keep going back for more snacks
     and end up overeating.
     This in the worst case can have knock on effects for days of low/bad
     energy!
 - YouTubeing.
   - Pro: Is relaxing.
   - Con: Can lead to time consuming rabbit hole.
