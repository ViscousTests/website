# Thoughts on Education

## Extended Education Concept

In high school and college I often felt extremely mentally busy. I was usually
in 5+ hours a day of classes teaching radically different things. Synthesizing
and remembering everything I was taught was difficult, and I fear that many of
those hours were wasted simply because I didn't have the mental bandwidth to
get all the information to stick.

Post-college, I feel like I have much more mental bandwidth for learning.  I'm
well able to fill this with books, podcasts, and other online resources.
Despite this, I sometimes wonder if generally speaking formal education could
do a better job of utilizing mental bandwidth over time.  By this I mean
"hybridizing" college and other pursuits more than they already are.

For example, instead of being a full time vocation, college could instead
involving taking 1 class per quarter/semester and spending the rest of one's
time working or doing whatever else you would otherwise do post-graduation.
This would lead to college taking longer to provide the same level of
education.

This could cause problems for people who want to start a skill-requiring job
as soon as possible. I wonder if it's possible to front-load practical
prerequisites early in the education cycle for such jobs. In my experience in
technical fields so far, there are only a few requirements I've truly needed
from my education; otherwise most of my skills have been learned on the job.
