# Brain Juice

I'm not sure exactly how, but I feel that my brain behaves similarly to my
muscles in that it can tire on both short and long timescales when used.  My
mind feels tired after making lots of new connections (learning new things) and
especially when critically re-validating my existing connections. It also feels
tired when doing the same thing many times, even if that thing is a simple
expression of a deeply ingrained skill.
