# What standard of thought should be expect from people?

I recently read *What's Our Problem* by Tim Urban, where he makes the case that
many of our current societal divisions are caused by more primitive parts of our
minds dominating the conversation.
He argues that our "higher minds" that are capable of considering many
conflicting perspectives to seek truth should instead be driving the
conversation.
Specifically, Tim argues that all perspectives should be open to higher-minded
discussion and shutting down discussion on certain topics is dangerously
illiberal.

Tim admits that using our higher minds requires effort, and it is impractical to
completely ignore the primitive mind.
I strongly agree.
In fact, I think that use of the higher mind to discover some truths is
extremely labor intensive, and the resulting truths are hard won artifacts.
To me this means that we should really do a better job of recording and
cataloging these artifacts so that when discussion comes up about them, we can
point directly to them as a way to end the conversation (as opposed to doing the
higher minded dance all over again).

In my opinion, encouraging open mindedness on every subject invites people to
entertain ideas that have been proven wrong for way too long.
In some ways, people use "open mindedness" as an excuse to promote bad ideas.
It would be better to focus on organizing and preserving the arguments
for/against ideas, and make it more of a cultural norm to shut down promotion of
bad ideas unless the promoter has something novel to add to the conversation.
Of course, the burden of digging through all the prior art to figure out if
their contribution is novel is on the promoter to do.

Shifting our discussion in this way puts more realistic expectations on people.
Accurately and correctly constructing an argument for an idea is hard and error
prone, which IMO is why many people just give up and use their primitive minds
to make decisions.

I don't think freedom of speech should be suppressed by any means here.
I'm purely speaking about cultural norms, not legal changes.
