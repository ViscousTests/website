# Pressure and Integrity

When people end up stressed or under pressure, they will more often "cheat" or
otherwise violate their integrity.
To assume otherwise is IMO naively optimistic.

Instead of telling yourself that you have principles you will never violate, it
may be better to focus your energy on recognizing what causes stress/pressure so
that you can avoid or otherwise manage it.
This IMO is a more realistic way to uphold integrity.

## Anecdotes

Some anecdotes that illustrate this thought:

 - [Slurgi cheating on bbros run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1iBJNzZaGQ)
 - People who get violent when angry
 - Probably Dark and Darker developers
