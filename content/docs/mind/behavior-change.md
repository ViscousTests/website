# Behavior Change

Building new habits is really important to making permanent improvement to your
life.  Doing new things is hard though.  One thing that helps me work through
this is realizing that every new thing (no matter how trivial) is going to be
difficult, and I'll need to sculpt the pathways in my brain to make it easy.

For example, if I want to eat more potatoes, taking the time to conscientiously
learn how to cook them quickly and efficiently will help me automatically cook
them when I'm tired and just want to eat something.
