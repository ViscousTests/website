# Optimism

> Optimism is a duty.
> The future is open.
> It is not predetermined.
> No one can predict it, except by chance.
> We all contribute to determining it by what we do.
> We are all equally responsible for its success.
> - Karl Popper and/or Immanuel Kant

Real progress requires the act of creation, which in turn requires the belief
that positive changes are possible, which IMO is a definition of optimism.

It is easy to sit back and point out all the flaws in the world - the creations
of others.
Sometimes this can be useful because it inspires new creation, but many many
people do not have this goal in mind when they do this.
Pure "destructive" pessimism rather causes all sorts of problems:

1. It fosters a helpless victimhood mindset, which almost by definition can't lead
to productive action.
1. It can lead to "burn it down" actions that leave a worse world in their wake.
Various political revolutions come to mind.
1. It's socially infectious - others can be convinced to take up the same mindset
easily.
It is temping to blame the world when things go wrong after all.
