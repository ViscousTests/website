# Myers-Briggs Type Indication (MBTI)

## Extroverted - Introverted

## Intuitive - Observant

One perspective: If your brain is trying to build a wall of information, a more
**Observant** mind will use bricks it finds with its senses in the world around
it (either via memories or present sensations).  A more **Intuitive** mind will
gather less bricks from around it and instead spent more time combining the bricks it already has into new "fusion" bricks to build into the wall.
