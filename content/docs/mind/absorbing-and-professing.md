# States of Mind

These states can be mixed together, but are at their strongest when the mind is
fully focused on one at a time.


## Professing - Performing - A State of Action

In this state, the information already contained in your neural patterns is
simply being projected as is into the world onto some medium.  This could be
into the air as speech, onto paper as writing, or into your body as any physical
activity (e.g. dancing, biking, etc.).  In this model, pure professing involves
no self reflection or change whatsoever.  If there is adaptation to the
unpredictable physical world, it is through if/then branches that choose simply
between already constructed neural patterns.  

Being in this state requires some combination of practice or training to build
the mental patterns, and a framework of assumptions that keeps the mind from
examining what it is doing too closely.  

In the extreme, pure profession can be animalistic and stubborn. Being in a 
professing state leads to confidence and strong ego.

Being in this state can be physically draining, but mentally I find I can be in this state for a long time before needing a break.

People tend to express this state more the older they get (i think).


### Flow

Being in a strong professing state can lead to a "flow" state, where the world
is continually validating your stored patterns and it feels like everything is
going "right".  I believe this state enables the acts of greatest skill or
talent that are possible for people.  This is a state of “effortless effort” as described in Zen philosophy.

I think the key to flow is to always have a readily accessible pathway for your mind to take when it runs into an issue.  Preparation/practice builds these pathways; it is easier to get into flow doing something you have done many times before.


## Absorbing - Learning - A State of Observation

In counter to profession, a state of absorption occurs when a mind is focused
instead on taking in new information while making few/no assumptions about the
world.  In this state, instead of continually acting, one continually
questions, expanding the problem space without looking at its details.  This
happens often when being exposed to new information or questioning assumptions
one has about old information.  New mental connections and memories are being
created actively in this state.

When in this state, a mind is very sensitive to any external feedback to
correct its action.  This can manifest as insecurity or anxiety if pressure is
applied during this state of mind.

This state of mind can be paralyzing, as it lays bare the overwhelming
complexity of everything as you continue to zoom out.  However, it also leads to
interesting connections that you may not see otherwise.

Extreme absorption/mindfulness can lead to analysis paralysis or meaningless
theorizing that is too far removed from reality to be useful.  Also
procrastination.

Younger people tend to express this state more (i think).  This thought
inspired by “How to Change Your Mind” by Michael Pollan.

Being in this state is very draining, as your mind has to constantly
reconfigure its thoughts reactively to match external feedback.  For me to be
most effective, I need to take short and long breaks from this state (even
“sleeping on” what I’m learning) to solidify memories and make them
“professable”.  Too much raw absorption becomes counterproductive, as my mind
is too tired to even hold on to the recent changes, let alone make more new
ones.

When learning in this state, there will almost always be blind alleys you must
go down to eventually find a model of (or perspective on) the world that works.
This explains why learning can be such a "stop and go" process - it's easy to
be stuck on a concept for a while before it finally clicks.  Also I think one’s
tolerance for blind alleys directly correlates to how good they are at
learning.

  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to
    succeed.


## Switching states

In order to get better at something, both absorbing AND professing are equally
important often in alternating steps.  

See [this Skyline video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLloQvOv1W4) for a
description about how this process works for a game like Overwatch
specifically.

Learning how to do something new under pressure of your own or other’s
expectations can be hard.  Specifically, it is stressful to take mental
pathways you have recently worked on as an absorber and apply them assuming
they will work (with penalty for failure).  

Someone who “thrives in ambiguity” is bold about applying untested pathways and
has a low fear of failure - or has set expectations properly such that failure
is not a big problem.  Alternatively, this person is willing to take on
perspectives and run with them even if there is a threat that their taken
perspective does not match the perspective/expectations of others they are
working with.  


## Ideas to test

 - Do you actually have a worse memory for events that happened to you when in
   a professing state?

# Focus

This is unrelated to the above states of mind.  

One way I think of focus is as getting buy in from your mind to fully engage in
some work (mental or physical).  Often the mind expects some pay off for doing
this, since it takes energy and time to be fully engaged.  [This
snippet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryB_VQ__KeE) by Jonathan Blow does a
great job describing how focus can be disrupted ([full
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej_3NKA3pk)).

A good way to encourage focus is to set yourself up so that external “things I should also think about” are absent.  For example:

 - Writing thoughts down so that your brain doesn’t feel pressure to remember
   them (else they would be lost).
 - Keeping your goals “in front” of you.  This could mean laying out your
   workspace so that all that’s needed to do your task is at hand.  This could
   mean keeping opponents in a game within your field of view.  Being in a
   situation where you have to “turn your head around” physically or
   metaphorically to keep abreast can lead to breaks in focus.
 - Putting walls up between yourself and other tasks, like by putting your
   phone in another room when trying to focus on something.

Another useful idea is to try to enumerate the things you want to do before
starting on them.  If this list is written down (or even remembered), going
back to it can be a stimulus that competes with other environmental
distractions or thoughts.  For instance, a common pattern I notice is (1) I
complete a task, (2) I have to refocus on something else, (3) some random
environmental stimulus grabs my focus (e.g. an email, article, chore).  When I
have a list of things I want to do, then those become part of the set of
environmental stimuli, making it more likely that I do them instead of
something else.  This system is most effective when the list is very
accessible; this could mean physically at hand, or recently created so it is
fresh in your mind.  It also helps to consciously pause right after stage (1)
above (completing a task), instead of directly jumping to the next thing with
little thought - this simple pause really helps your next task be intentional
and not dictated by your environment.
