# Intelligence

**Disclaimer:** This is not based on any specific research, just my own personal
observations and discussions.
I would love to be shown that any of this is wrong!

I don't think that intelligence is a useful concept, and don't think that some
kind of "general intelligence" (e.g. IQ) even exists in the way it's commonly
invoked (e.g. "Alex is more intelligent than Tom").

My main critique is that the human brain is _very_ context/domain specific in
it's ability.
A good analogy is athleticism.
Sumo wrestlers, sprinters, archers, and football players can all be considered
"athletic", but their talents are all scoped very narrowly to their respective
sports.
I would argue that the brain is like this, but x100.
Would a talented typist be considered more "intelligent" than someone good at
solving sudoku puzzles?
Is someone good at solving the problems posed in IQ tests more "intelligent"
than a creative scientist?
Trying to make these comparisons is, in my opinion, silly.

One interesting thought is that maybe intelligence can be defined as the ease at
which new skills can be learned?
I would argue that this is also very domain specific.
Also this would imply that newborn infants are very intelligent, which runs
counter to our intuitions about the word.

Alternatively, maybe intelligence is the number of skills one is proficient in?
This seems more reasonable, but still has major flaws.
For one, how would difficulty of skills be considered, if at all?

Some skills, like "reasoning", "deduction", or "argument" seem like they should
be proxies for intelligence.
I think skills like this can be learned like many others, and are built by
etching heuristics and patterns into your brain.
