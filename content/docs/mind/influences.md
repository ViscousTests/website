# Influences

These works have guided my thinking about how the mind works. They are roughly
sorted by their level of influence on my thinking.

## [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

Refreshing read that shows that building good habits and systems in your life
is much more effective and doable than using raw willpower to get achieve
goals.

## [Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)

Video inspired by book done by Veritasium [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBVV8pch1dM&ab_channel=Veritasium).

## Books by David Eagleman

Incognito, Livewired, The Brain: The Story of You.  All great pop-neuroscience
reads!  Incognito especially left a big impression of me when I read it as a
freshman in college.

## [Investing in Happiness by Ben Felix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNZk-N6uDcg&ab_channel=BenFelix)

Great review of a lot of happiness literature, presented in a direct, clear way.

## [How to Change your Mind by Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/)

Interesting history of psychedelics in the USA, with some particularly
insightful ideas about how the brain is organized (and works) in the last few
chapters.

## [Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683)

Cool lecture series, not done yet!
