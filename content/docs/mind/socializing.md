## Positive Vibes

It helps form connections with others to all be in a similar positive mental
state when you are together.
People commonly use drugs (e.g. food, alcohol) to get into this state, but other
activities that everyone is excited about can do it too.
Exercise can also help.

## Disruption

Any given person has a whole host of thoughts and concerns that are constantly
coming up and being resolved in their heads.
Resolving those concerns can be done in many ways, for example:

1. Actually doing a real world task that resolves the concern (fixing something,
   or looking up a piece of information).
1. Writing down the task as a reminder to do it later.
1. Delegating the task to someone else (or an automation).
1. Simply talking through, or thinking through, the issue.

All of these resolution methods can be done with the assistance of other people.
However, when doing so, you necessarily disrupt (add to) the roil of thoughts in
the other's head(s).
This is not necessarily a bad thing - perhaps the other person/people is/are
looking for things to do - but it is good to be aware of.

If you constantly voice your own roil of thoughts as a way to manage it, or
simply be social, you can be exhausting to be around.
