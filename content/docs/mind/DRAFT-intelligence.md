# "Intelligence"

In my opinion, intelligence as a concept is a harmful oversimplification.  My
thoughts on several contexts in which the word is used are described here:

## Ability to Learn


Tests judging intelligence, or general mental ability, are used to decide
whether students at all levels are capable of participating in certain
educational activities.
These activities include taking certain courses and being admitted into certain
programs or schools.


## Social Perception

People use intelligence to describe each other in a general way.
