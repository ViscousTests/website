# Creativity

## Constraining the Problem Space

One of the main enemies of creative work getting done is the "blank page" - the
mental state of staring at a blank page and being paralyzed either with too
many thoughts or no thoughts.  One useful tool to avoid this is by constraining
your problem space, sometimes dramatically.  For instance, what if you could
only fold the page and do nothing else?  Suddenly, it's much easier (for me at
least) to start just doing something. This helps a lot with "Just Getting
Started".

## Just Getting Started

Once you get on the path of creation, the small choices you encounter will
generally be much more manageable decisions, and through them something complex
often emerges.

## Remixing

Our minds create new things by mixing the old together.  A classic examination
of this is [Everything is a
Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc).


## Vision and Confidence

Being "Determinant" as described by Peter Thiel in [You Are Not a
Lottery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZM_JmZdqCw) may help with this.
