## Sleep

Wear socks to sleep so that:
1. Feet don't get uncomfortably cold
1. Sheets can lie more nicely around my body, without needing to be stretched
   out to cover my feet (and letting more breezes in).

Playing FPS or other games within and hour or so of sleeping can make it harder
to fall asleep, but may not affect sleep quality after falling asleep.


## Food

Overeating kills productivity.
