# Great Talks

After each talk are listed my major takeaways from it.

## Software

- [Simple made Easy by Rich Hickey](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/)
  - Complex = entangled = difficult to reason about
  - To make systems more understandable, need to reduce them to small,
    **independant** pieces (like pure functions with no side effects)
- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
  - Stepping back from a problem and doing other things or sleeping allows
    unconscious parts of your mind draw connections that you otherwise wouldn't
    draw.  This allows you to solve problems that otherwise would be much harder
    or impossible.
- [Thinking Above the Code by Leslie Lamport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q)
  - It is easy to trick yourself that you are thinking rationally when you do
    not share your thoughts by writing them down or speaking them out loud.  If
    you are serious about solving a problem, write down your thought process!

## Game Design
