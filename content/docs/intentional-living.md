# Living Intentionally

It's easy to get swept up in life and let your behavior be dictated by your
environment (e.g. what others around you are doing).

It's dangerous to do this since your environment is not a sentient being and
therefore does not care about anything, let alone your personal
happiness/satisfaction/fulfillment.

It's worth taking a step back and consciously running through whether you agree
with your environment's influence or not frequently.  Otherwise you might end
up less happy/satisfied/fulfilled than you might otherwise be.
