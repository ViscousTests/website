# Dead of Winter

A cooperative strategy board game that doesn't require too much inter-player
planning (see [Limiting Collaboration]({{< relref
"/docs/gamedev/mechanic-ideas/limiting-collaboration.md" >}}) for why this can
be a problem).  Has a couple cool mechanics that I really enjoyed playing with:

1. Before every players turn another player pulls an "event" card that will
   only lead to something if the player whose turn it is does something
   specific. This leads to a fun dynamic of one player knowing what might
   happen (good or bad) if the current player takes a specific action.
1. Secret victory conditions. This is a common feature in many games, but in a
   cooperative game that may have "betrayers" it leads to a fun dynamic where
   you have to be a bit cagey about how much you say about your specific
   condition, lest others suspect you are up to no good.

Played first in June 2022.
