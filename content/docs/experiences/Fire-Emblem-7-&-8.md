# [Fire Emblem 7 & 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_(video_game%29)

I first played this game on the Game Boy Advance when I was in middle school.For some reason the art style and especially animation really spoke to me, andI found the gameplay loop very compelling. Fair warning though that this gamemay be on this list mostly because of nostalgia.One aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building yourparty over time and making sure you train the right characters. It's verysatisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience with thegoal of making them a core part of your team composition later on. This isoften fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which onlyadds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.Another cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters. When twocharacters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, whichleads to little dialogue bites. It's satisfying to discover these as you playthrough the game.Both training weaker units and building supports are examples of'meta-challenges' in FE; they aren't required to finish the games, but give youself-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles.Because these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I amexpressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interestingthan if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.
