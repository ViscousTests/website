# Drafting Magic: The Gathering

My first experience was 'that complex card game that older kids played' when I was very young. Faintly remember that I specifically thought the lands were really cool, have specific memory of the plains. Started playing first from a friend's cube (a collection of cards you can draft decks from and then play each other in a tournament style). Was pretty intense/overwhelming at first, but in a good way. Since have played a bunch on MTG: Arena, a very polished computer interface to the game.
