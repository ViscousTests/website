# Game Types/Mechanics/Appeals

## Engine Building

When a player continually updates a state (e.g. a farm or rpg character or desk) with
new elements, with each step making the state better at acheiving some goal.  Often,
the state will become even better with each update that the last update made it; the
rate of state betterment per step is convex.  In the end, the state may be able to
"go infinite" or otherwise reach some victory game state in one turn.

### Examples

 - The game board is an engine in Magic: TG.
 - The player boards + cards in Agricola.
 - The player boards in Wingspan.
