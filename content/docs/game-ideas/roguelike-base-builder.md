# Rogue-like Base Builder Concept

Game is played on a square grid in two phases.

## Setup Phase

Here, the player uses resources they've accumulated to
build a base defending their sage (you).  This includes:
 - Building walls
 - Deploying units as archers/warriors
 - Digging moats
 - Making traps
 - Building farms or other buildings that do not help defend,
   but accumulate resources for next round.

## Combat Phase

After setup, the base is attacked by a wave of enemies.
At this point, the player has no control, and just gets to
watch their design work (or not).  This automatic combat is
done is waves, where the entire enemy team moves/attacks at
once, then the entire friendly team moves/attacks at once.

## Goal of the Game

Survive X number of waves.  Perhaps the more waves you survive
the more interesting the game gets (or there are multiple endings).

## Progression

When starting the game, you can choose from multiple "biomes" or "campaigns"
that play out in a predictable way.  I want the player to feel like they are
learning with every defeat, just like in every time loop in Outer Wilds.  I
want to avoid unfair/random mechanics that many roguelikes utilize to perhaps
artificially extend the game and make it more grindy.
