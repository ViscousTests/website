# Emotions (and Relationships)

If someone has a strong model in their head for how things should go (certain
expectations) with an additional expectation that others will help make that
model a reality, it can lead to conflict.

It always takes some effort for the helper to understand what the expector
wants, but this is exacerbated if the request is ambiguous.  People do not
respond well to situations where a high pressure is placed on them that they do
not know how to resolve.
