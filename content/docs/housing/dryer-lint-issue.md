# Dryer Lint Issue

The dryer downstairs in my house has a long circuitous vent.
Also, it has in the past failed several times, once needing a replacement.

Recently, with the help of an endoscope camera, I was able to confirm that the
main issue with the dryer is in fact lint getting stuck in the vent:

I tried for over an hour to get it out with a snake, with little success.
It all had accumulated in a central spot that was very hard to reach.

Then I learned that a leaf blower is a great tool for clearing dryer vents and
my problem was solved!
