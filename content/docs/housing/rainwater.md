# Rainwater

We signed up for
https://kingcounty.gov/services/environment/wastewater/cso/rainwise.aspx to
manage our rainwater.

## Water Pressure

Going through a normal length garden hose, the water pressure we experienced was
really low, sometimes unusably low if the hose ran a circuitous path.

I solved this problem with https://amzn.to/3VlNGMu attached to the end of the
hose to be used to e.g. water plants.
After a couple pumps it forms a siphon and water flows freely!
