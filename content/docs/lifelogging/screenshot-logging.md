# Lifelogging via Screenshots

Pictures are easy to take and contain a ton of context-rich information.
Therefore, they are a great way to easily lifelog.


## Manual

On windows, pressing Win+PrnScn will take a screenshot and place it in the
Home\\Pictures\\Screenshots folder.
Using the Google Drive desktop app you can mark this folder so that all photos
places to it automatically get uploaded to Google Photos.


## Fully automatic

This method generates a lot of images, which makes it harder to view them in a
timeline easily.

describes a good method to do this on windows.
