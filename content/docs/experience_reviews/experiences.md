# Experiences

Each experience has a approximate date when I had it, or first started
experiencing it if it is recurring.


## Climbing

I find climbing to be a very satisfying and fulfilling activity.
Getting on a new route 

### At the IMA Crags - 2013

First started regularly climbing here with Alex Thompson (or maybe someone else?
I don't remember the first time).  The textured walls make it really
interesting, especially for using feet in interesting/stemmy ways.  A favorite
project is the arete right at the entrance to the right with only wall texture.
Very doable and almost done!

### At Vertical World - 2016

I remember going to Vertical World for a birthday party when I was really young,
but don't remember the details.  Started climbing regularly when working at
Arzeda, since it was so close.


## Working in Water Treatment lab (Prof. Mark Benjamin) - 2013


## Working in EE Building as Tech Support - 


## Working in Pfaentner lab - 2015


## Working at Arzeda - 2/2016

Saw ad for job on Hyak (UW Supercomputer) mailing list, which I was on since I
used Hyak for Pfaentner lab research.  Sounded awesome, so I responded with my
resume and low expectations.  Got call back from Andrew Ban, who very excitedly
explained what I'd be working on (pathway design).  Went in for interview with
Alex Zanghellini and Andrew after reading the Diels-Alderase paper and maybe
skimming some others.  I remember not realizing in the moment that enzymes not
only reduce entropy for reaction by arranging atoms in right places, but also
interacting with the atoms using their amino acid residue sidechains.  Was super
exited to get the job!  Started working two afternoons a week with Michael
Galdzicki and Rudesh Toofanny, mostly with Mike at first.  


## Climbing McMahon - 2014

After thinking about it and testing out the movements going down and up a floor,
I climbing from my unit's balcony (7th floor?) in the McMahon dorms to the top
floor (11?).  Mostly this felt quite safe; there was just one section of three
stacked balconies that required stepping out over some exposure (3 floors to the
balcony that would catch me).  This section required going to a balcony right
above the current one, making me step onto the railing, doing a bit of an
undercling on the bottom on the upper balcony, and reaching out to grab the
steel railing above.  Then pulling myself up was easy.

This experience made me feel powerful and capable, even though it was probably
in the 5.8 range of difficulty - made a bit easier given my height.  It was also
cool to surprise some people hanging out on their own balconies : ).  

## Skyrim - 11/11/2011

## Team Fortress 2

## Counter Strike: Global Offensive

## Apex Legends - 2019-2020

Awesome game that I've enjoyed more the more I've played it.  Much better to play
when in voice chat with teammates.

### Tips to be better

Focus on using cover.  Always try to engage enemies with some object in between you
that you can use to cover ~40% of your screen with to make you harder to hit.  Avoid
situations where an opponent can easily catch you without a easy bit of cover to
move to.

Positioning is very helpful to win games.  Staying above opponents consistantly will
let you keep an advantage and win against mechanically better players.

## Rainbow 6: Siege

Very intense and engaging game that requires a high level of focus.  
Every movement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement
gives away your position and makes you vulnerable.  
However, like in most shooters, if you proactively move to shoot at a particular
point, you will still have an advantage against someone reacting to your
movement.
This leads to a dynamic where both you and your opponent are trying to determine
the location of the other without giving away their own location - once one
person knows with certainty they can simply move to attack and will have a
strong advantage.

This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes, which have
attacking and defending sides.
Attackers must move to engage the defenders, meaning that they start out
disadvantaged (they are moving and making noise while defenders are not). 
To counter this, attackers all have remote control drones that make noise when
they move around. 
These are easily destroyed, but can be used to determine the locations of
defenders, giving attackers advantage.


## Rainbow 6: Vegas

Cool game with some awkward movement and other mechanics.  Had a really annoying
bug for me where gun sounds would continually loop sometimes, leading eventually
to many accumulating and making the game a bit unplayable.  


## Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse - 7/2019

Great story, cool themes about family and parenting.  Also about self discovery.
Quintessential all-ages kind of film.


## Inside Out - 2015

I loved the modelling of the mind as a collection of different emotions
competing for control.  Really made me get invested with the main character, and
made me cry when things started going poorly for her at one point.  Discussion
this movie might be a good way to connect with people that are otherwise fairly
different.  


## The Matrix - 2008?

Watched with Dad after being told that it would be very hard to understand.
Turned out that wasn't true for either of us.

Excellent sci-fi, where sci-fi is defined as a medium that explores how new
plausible technologies would affect the world.  Action/style was very compelling
to.  Favorite movie for many years, perhaps even still in some ways.

I think the sequels are pretty good, unlike many others.


## Magic: The Gathering - 2015

First experience was "that complex card game that older kids played" when I was
very young.  Faintly remember that I specifically thought the lands were
really cool, have specific memory of the plains.  

Started playing first from David Lin's cube (a collection of cards you can draft
decks from and then play each other in a tournament style).  Was pretty
intense/overwhelming at first, but in a good way.  


## Agricola - 2015
