# Influences

These works have guided my thinking about how to discover truths about the
world. They include examinations of general patterns that reappear in many
parts of the world - understanding these I feel helps hasten future discovery,
so I put them in this section of the website.  These sources are roughly sorted
by their level of influence on my thinking.


## [The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity)

Excellent book that addresses (a theory for) how knowledge is created and the
implications that has for humankind, and "people" more generally. David's
theory is that knowledge is created by filtering many creative conjectures into
those that give the best explanations for things via a tradition of criticism.


## [Antifragile by Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)

Really insightful book into types of systems in the world and how they behave.
Specifically those that manifest "antifragile" behaviors.

### What is Antifragility?

Fragile - hurt by random variation
Robust - not sensitive to anything
Antifraile - hurt by lack of variation


### Convexity/Concavity

The fragile is well represented by a concave distribution - outcomes are fine
most of the time, but can sometimes be catastrophic.

The antifragile is well represented by a convex distribution - outcomes are
fine most of the time, but can sometimes be very good.


### Theorizing vs Tinkering

Theorizing involves making many (tested or untested) logical steps to explain a
behavior.  This is most effective in simple systems with little
self-interaction (e.g. toy physics models).  When applied to complex systems,
theorizing can be fragile.

Random tinkering is done by making immediate decisions (hopefully with multiple
options) in a more near-sighted way.  The results of these decisions feed back
into the process, hopefully stumbling the tinkerer closer to a solution.  This
is antifragile - your expectations are low most of the time, but sometimes you
stumble onto something very groundbreaking.

## [_Zero to One_ by Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One)

Interesting book that tries to answer the question of (1) what kinds of work
will have the highest (positive) impact on humanity and (2) how to do that
work.

My short synopsis: _Zero to One_ argues that completely novel ideas that don't
directly compete in any existing markets lead to the most successful businesses
and the most positive change for humanity. Therefore, we should focus our
energy on being different, "thinking for ourselves", and coming up with the
most bold, creative ideas possible as opposed to diversifying our interests and
seeking incremental change.
