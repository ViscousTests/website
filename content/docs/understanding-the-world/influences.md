# Influences

These works have guided my thinking about how to discover truths about the
world. They include examinations of general patterns that reappear in many
parts of the world - understanding these I feel helps hasten future discovery,
so I put them in this section of the website.  These sources are roughly sorted
by their level of influence on my thinking.


## [Antifragile by Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)

Really insightful book into types of systems in the world and how they behave.
Specifically those that manifest "antifragile" behaviors.

### What is Antifragility?

Fragile - hurt by random variation
Robust - not sensitive to anything
Antifraile - hurt by lack of variation


### Convexity/Concavity

The fragile is well represented by a concave distribution - outcomes are fine
most of the time, but can sometimes be catastrophic.

The antifragile is well represented by a convex distribution - outcomes are
fine most of the time, but can sometimes be very good.


### Theorizing vs Tinkering

Theorizing involves making many (tested or untested) logical steps to explain a
behavior.  This is most effective in simple systems with little
self-interaction (e.g. toy physics models).  When applied to complex systems,
theorizing can be fragile.

Random tinkering is done by making immediate decisions (hopefully with multiple
options) in a more near-sighted way.  The results of these decisions feed back
into the process, hopefully stumbling the tinkerer closer to a solution.  This
is antifragile - your expectations are low most of the time, but sometimes you
stumble onto something very groundbreaking.
