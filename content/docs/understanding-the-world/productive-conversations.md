# Productive Conversations

 - Start with "what would convince you that you're wrong?"
 - Talk about how specific possibilities make you feel, then try to pin down
   why.
   This can lead to identifying more specific concerns that may not be the same
   as the initial point of argument.
 - Don't change the subject or gloss over a point until it is resolved.
   Especially don't counter a point with something unrelated.
 - Make sure the objective of the conversation is crystal clear to all parties
   (state it explicitly).
 - Ask people to explain how the thing that's being discussed works (objectively).
