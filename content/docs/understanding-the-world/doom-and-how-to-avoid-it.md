# Doom, and how to avoid it

## We got problems

 - climate change
 - income inequality
 - asteroids
 - natural disasters
 - pandemics
 - everyone dies of old age

## We need to solve them

The development of new systems and technologies is the only way we are going to
be able to solve all our problems in the long term. In the past, innovated or
luck are the only ways we've been able to circumvent large problems, and
relying on luck long term will lead to externally-caused extinction or self
destruction at some point.

Currently, people are the only entities we know of that can actively create new
solutions to problems in a reasonable timescale. Therefore, **it is critical
that we get as many people as possible to spend their time innovating**. We
should aggressively be trying to get this to happen in at least two ways:

1. Building systems of information transfer that make innovation easier or even
   accessible to most people.
1. Working hard to automate away things that currently suck up our time.

### Making Innovation Accessible

Right now, it is not easy for a random person to make meaningful progress on
solving the world's problems. There are a couple reasons why that we should
work to invalidate:

1. Learning about existing research is hard
  - Conferences are very expensive to attend
  - Publications are expensive to read
    - Sites like sci-hub make this easier
  - Formal education is expensive and time consuming
1. Engaging in serious conversations about these problems with a manageable
   amount of people is hard.
  - Probably there are ways to creating online or local communities to fix
    this.
1. It is hard to get motivated to work on these hard problems in our current
   culture.
  - I'm not sure how to solve this, but we should try to learn more about how
    to make this a more core societal value.

### Automation

People spend too much time on non-creative tasks.  Automation with a good
wealth redistribution system should eliminate this wasted time.
