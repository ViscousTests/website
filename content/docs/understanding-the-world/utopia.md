# Achieving Utopia

## Problems

Humanity has some big problems that need to be solved before we can safely say
we have built a utopia.

### Wasted Human Potential

Most people spend their productive time doing work that does not materially
move our society forward.  As discussed later, people have the potential to
create completely new ideas that radically and positively improve the lives of
humanity as a whole. Any work that does not leverage this potential by
definition wastes it, slowing our progress toward a utopia.

If our economy could somehow adequately value this potential, a lot of these
problems might solve themselves (as the cost of labor would be prohibitive).

#### Maintenance Work

This kind of work is currently necessary work that keeps society from
backsliding.  It is extremely important, but we should be working to automate
it or find ways to avoid needing it to make progress.

#### Service Work

In my opinion, most service work is already unnecessary given the alternatives.
It makes me sad to see so many people working as waiters/waitresses, cashiers,
in call centers, etc. when there are (often better) systems that provide the
same service without requiring people.

#### Not Seeing the Potential

Rejecting the idea that all humans have creative potential is commonplace, and
greatly harms the many people that are discriminated against when selection for
creative roles occurs. TODO flesh this out.

### Death

The death of an individual is extremely tragic for at least these reasons:

 - All the knowledge and perspective the individual accumulated over their
   lifetime is lost permanently. Records can only partially remedy this.
 - The social web the person was a part of is violently damaged.
 - The people close to the dying person suffer greatly and are less able to
   create for a time (sometimes permanently).

To protect ourselves emotionally, we have built traditions and societal norms
around accepting death and treating it an inevitable.  Given our progress
towards understanding aging (the cause of the vast majority of deaths), this is
starting to become a problem.

### War

The terrible combination of the above two problems. Should be avoided at all
costs.


## Solutions

In my opinion, we should be putting **all** people to work solving the above
problems. In doing so, we should be able to reach utopia more quickly, and in
so doing alleviate much suffering.

### Humanity's Superpower

People have the uniquely powerful ability to come up with arbitrary
explanations for how stuff works and then critically compare them against each
other. This creative process has led to all major advances in human history,
and is responsible for the accelerating rate of progress we all enjoy today.
This progress is in turn responsible for alleviating a tremendous amount of
suffering, and for creating a myriad of new ways for people to feel happy,
satisfied, or otherwise good.  It also has enabled people to automate many time
and energy consuming tasks that have historically either directly caused
suffering, or gotten in the way of further progress and/or doing things that
feel good.

Creative thought as I've defined it is the most important tool we have to
improve our state as a species (and to continue avoiding existential threats).
Therefore, we should be primarily orienting our society to encourage creative
thought and reduce the amount of time required to engage in non-creative work
to keep things running. If we can successfully do this, then we will maximize
our ability to solve all other hard problems facing our species, such as
resource shortages, aging, climate change, and successfully governing
ourselves. Additionally, arguably people will lead more fulfilling lives, as
more of their time will be spent thinking about interesting things and sharing
those thoughts as opposed to grinding away at Sisyphean maintenance tasks.

How can we do this?

### Basic Need Automation

We need to ensure that every person on earth has their basic (food, shelter,
medicine, mental health) needs met through automation. Worrying about basic
needs is probably the biggest distraction away from creative thought that
exists today.

A simple solution to this would be to supply everyone with a nanofabricator
that can produce food, tools, and everything else required to survive.
Unfortunately, currently this solution is still science fiction, and we instead
must rely on large shared systems that utilize economies of scale to provide
needs at a minimum cost. Distributing resources in these systems is hard, and
our growing wealth inequality today is evidence that we are doing a poor job.
Solving this problem via some kind of universal basic income seems at least
worth trying.

### Freedom of Information and Education

It's hard to think creatively when you have no prior ideas to remix together
into new ones. Making information and educational resources universally
accessible and engaging is crucial to spark creativity. To do this we should
continue encouraging the growth of the internet, and the growth of free and
open publication of scientific discovery (and thoughts in general). People who
write down novel ideas should have their needs covered by the automation
described above, and therefore will not need to worry about how to monetize
their work (which wastes everyone's time and energy, and cuts people out of the
creative process).


### Freedom of Direction

In the book "Greatness Cannot be Planned: The Myth of the Objective", the
authors argue that all hard problems suffer from deceptive paths to their
solutions. Therefore, attempting to grade or judge performance by comparing a
current state to a specific goal is misleading. This focus on objective
thinking is particularly dangerous when applied to people - using objectives to
encourage someone to do X or Y stifles that persons ability to exercise their
most powerful tool: their creativity. Instead, that person will just act in
accordance with the given objective, even if they have novel ideas they would
otherwise try to pursue.

To approach utopia, it makes sense to try to constrain the behavior of
individuals as little as possible so that the most novel ideas can be explored.
One way this could be conceptualized is by encouraging
[flaneur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur)-like behavior as
described in "Antifragile" by NN Taleb. This has the additional side benefit of
giving people space, time, and therefore ability to support the ideas of others
that they discover and think are important.

#### Organizations

This concept can also apply to larger organizations of many people, like local
governments.  If those governments have a lot of freedom to experiment with
different policies, this could lead to discovery of the best policies overall.
In practice, this would looks like a confederation of autonomous states, like
Switzerland and to a lesser extent the United States of America.

At the government level, this experimentation can be dangerous, so it is
crucial that people are able to leave governments that they anticipate will
harm them. This means that both some kind of universal bill of rights and
resources that help people move are extremely important.
