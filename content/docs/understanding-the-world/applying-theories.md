# Applying Theories

One way to look at learning is as a cyclical process:

1. Have some experiences in the world.
1. Mentally find commonalities between those experiences and create an abstract
   model in your head to help predict what might happen in a similar, future
   experience.
1. Test your model by having that future experience and seeing what happens.
1. Refine or discard the model as more experiences inform it.

A key trap to avoid falling in to here is exiting the loop and believing that
your model is "the truth". This assumes that all possible experiences have been
explored, which is impossible.

The presence of this trap does **not** mean abstract theories are useless or
not worth developing (because you will never find their solution). Abstract
models are in fact very useful as tools in your toolbox when approaching a new
experience. They just must be applied as hypotheses, and held lightly.

This kind of thinking can be hard sometimes, because it sort-of involves
holding two conflicting ideas in your head ([which is
painful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)). These are:

1. The theory explains how something abstract works.
1. The theory is only applicable in some concrete scenerios (and even then, may
   not be correct).

This is a bit of a paradox because to describe an abstract theory you
necessarily must state that it works in an abstract context. They key is
realizing that this explanation is incomplete. So you kinda have to "believe a
lie" in part to apply the theory.


## Example: Personality Typing

One very abstract theory is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)
for personality typing. It attempts to condense the complexity of an individual
person into a 4 letter code (4 binary dimensions) that describes their
behavior. This is extremely abstract and incomplete.

Despite the oversimplicity of MBTI, it can still be useful. For example, if two
people are clashing because they are approaching a problem in two different
ways (and each thinks their way is best), MBTI can give them a language with
which to see the validity of the other person's approach. Here the theory acts
as a neutral third party to help settle the dispute.

It could also not work in this situation at all depending on the people. The
danger is believing too much that the theory is correct and trying to force
its application. This is where general theories become dangerous. The best
approach if the theory's application isn't leading to practically useful
results (here helping the two people see eye-to-eye) is to move on to the next
theory in the toolbox that could help.
