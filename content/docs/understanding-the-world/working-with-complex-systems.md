# Working With Complex Systems

Systems of a sufficient complexity are hard/impossible to intuitively reason
about, or become an expert in.
One way to think about these systems is as "low validity environments" as
described in [the Veritasium video on
experts](https://youtu.be/5eW6Eagr9XA?t=321).

This means that predicting the future state of a complex system like the
economy, the health of a human, or a political system is extremely error prone.
That doesn't mean we should attempt this prediction, but IMO it does mean that
putting a lot of faith in predictions is a mistake.
It might be a better strategy to have different plans of action for different
possible outcomes.
