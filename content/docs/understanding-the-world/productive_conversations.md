# Productive Conversations

 - Start with "what would convince you that you're wrong?"
 - Talk about how specific possibilities make you feel, then try to pin down
   why.  This can lead to identifying more specific concerns that may not be
   the same as the initial point of argument.
 - Don't change the subject or gloss over a point until it is 
   resolved.  Especially don't counter a point with something unrelated.
