## Graph Notetaking Idea

Use a set of nodes connected to other notes in a graph (like
[zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)) to store knowledge.
Each note should have:

 - Constraints under which the notes info doesn't apply (limitation of a study)
 - Some new knowledge, assuming the constraint
 - References to other notes

In addition, the body of notes should contain guiding essays that string
together notes in an easy to understand way.  This way the graph of knowledge
is approachable, and essays/papers don't have to worry about not mentioning
things, since they are still notes.  Later essays can keep exploring the
unguided territory.  

This system has the benefit of encouraging new essays to form from the body of
work, which is always at hand and even partially connected already.
