## Mind as Multiple Actors

I find a useful way to think about my mind is as a congress of many (simple-ish)
actors.


## Myers-Briggs Type Indication (MBTI)

### Extroverted - Introverted

### Intuitive - Observant

One perspective: If your brain is trying to build a wall of information, a more
**Observant** mind will use bricks it finds with its senses in the world around
it (either via memories or present sensations).  A more **Intuitive** mind will
gather less bricks from around it and instead spent more time combining the bricks it already has into new "fusion" bricks to build into the wall.

See http://paulgraham.com/think.html for a possible description of this.
