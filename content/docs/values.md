# My Values

## Positive emotions

People feel positive emotions when their expectations for things are exceeded,
and negative emotions when expectations are not met. 

### Core Expectations

1. Water
1. Food
1. Temperature Equilibrium
1. Stability
   1. Feeling of being valued and/or respected from other members of society.
   1. Enough financial or other resources to sustain status quo.

These expectations are so hardwired into people that it takes tremendous effort
to try to change them, so much so that it's generally not worth trying.
