# This Website

This website was setup using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start) and is hosted using
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).  It uses the
[hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.  Originally, it was
started by copying the example project in the hugo-book repository, and
modifying the pages.
