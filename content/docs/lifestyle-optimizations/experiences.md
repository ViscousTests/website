# My Experiences

A summary of experiences I've had, and the states of mind they invoke for me.
See [Mind Mapping Concept]({{< relref
"/docs/thought-experiments/mind-mapping-concept.md" >}}) for ideas on how else
to display this.

Note that this view is obselete - the current way to view this is via the menu
sidebar.
