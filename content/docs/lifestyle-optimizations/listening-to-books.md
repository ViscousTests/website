# Listening to Books

When commuting I like to listen to podcasts or books for learning and
entertainment. Unfortunately, many books do not have audiobook versions.
Luckily, it's fairly easy to use text-to-speech engines to convert the text of
e books into audio.  See tools in this repo:

I was listening to https://www.lifespan.io/the-rejuvenation-roundup-podcast/
recently and noticed the voice of the presenter sounded a bit generated. I
reached out to the creators, and they say they use
[Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/?via=ryan-o-shea).  This would be amazing
for use in audiobook generation.
