# Mice

## Things I've tried

### PICTEK Gaming Mouse

Functional, but felt too small for my hands.

### Razer DeathAdder Essential

Has a tall center that I find a bit uncomfortable.

### Corsair Sabre RGB

Excellent shape, but not enough buttons!

### Logitech G502 Hero

More buttons, but some downgrades from the Sabre:

 - Mouse wheel is too hard to scroll when not in freewheel mode.
 - Mouse wheel scrolls itself when in freewheel mode!
 - Thumb does not touch table due to design of mouse.
   Also design feels like it was made for a smaller thumb than mine: a bit
   uncomfortable.
 - Feels slightly smaller overall, which is not as nice for my larger hands.

### Razer Naga

## To Try Perhaps?

### Corsair DARKSTAR WIRELESS RGB

 - Expensive
 - Has tilt gestures
 - Many complaints about build/technical issues

### Corsair IRONCLAW RGB WIRELESS

 - No mouse wheel side buttons

### Steelseries Rival 500 

 - Discontinued :(

### Swiftpoint Z2

 - Very unique!
 - Has tilt gestures
 - Expensive
