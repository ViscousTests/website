## Things I've tried

### PICTEK Gaming Mouse

Functional, but felt too small for my hands.

### Razer DeathAdder Essential

Has a tall center that I find a bit uncomfortable.

### Corsair Sabre RGB

Excellent shape, but not enough buttons!

### Logitech G502 Hero

More buttons, but some downgrades from the Sabre:

 - Mouse wheel is too hard to scroll when not in freewheel mode.
 - Mouse wheel scrolls itself when in freewheel mode!
 - Thumb does not touch table due to design of mouse.
   Also design feels like it was made for a smaller thumb than mine: a bit
   uncomfortable.
 - Feels slightly smaller overall, which is not as nice for my larger hands.

### Razer Naga

Felt so wrong in my hands, both very bulky and hard to grip, with my thumb
constantly not finding a good position due to the grid of buttons.

### Corsair DARKSTAR WIRELESS RGB

 - Expensive
 - Has tilt gestures, but NOT usable on linux with build in memory customization
   option.
 - Many complaints about build/technical issues
    - I personally experienced a creeky side-to-side scroll wheel button
      actuation, and the top left left-click button did not depress properly
      when hitting the front part of it.
      This is more annoying than it sounds.
 - For me, this mouse felt pretty good in my hand.  If anything a bit big.
 - Buttons are plentiful and easy to reach for the most part.

### Turtle Beach Kone Wireless XP

 - Amazing software, seems like all settings can be stored in mouse memory as
   well
 - Many buttons, including cool "easy shift" button that is very easy to use
   with thumb
 - Kinda small for my hand to palm.
 - "easy shift" button acts as thumb shelf, and my thumb feels too big for the
   shelf slot, just like the Logitech G502
 - very cool lighting that seems to appear out of nowhere and gives the mouse depth

I wish my hand fit this mouse better :(.
