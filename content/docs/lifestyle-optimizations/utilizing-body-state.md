# Utilizing the State of your Body

TODO come up with a better name for this page

When I feel cold or warm or hungry or full, my body will be more amenable to
doing certain things.  For instance, when I'm cold, it's easier for me to do
computer work (writing, coding, etc.) quickly and much harder for me to sleep.
Hunger has a similar effect. Noticing these patterns can make it possible to set
up your schedule and environment to take advantage of this differing bodily
amenability.

For example, when I cook food I try to do all the cleaning (e.g. dishwasher
loading and emptying) either while I'm cooking or right before I eat. The
hunger and already moving state of my body makes it much easier to do this than
it would be if I had just finished eating and was sitting down in a relaxed
state.
