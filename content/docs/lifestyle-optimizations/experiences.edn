  Excellent sci-fi, where sci-fi is defined as a medium that explores how new

  to.  Favorite movie for many years, perhaps even still in some ways.

  I think the sequels are pretty good, unlike many others."

 ["Drafting Magic: The Gathering"

  Started playing first from a friend's cube (a collection of cards you can draft
  decks from and then play each other in a tournament style).  Was pretty
  intense/overwhelming at first, but in a good way.  

  Since have played a bunch on MTG: Arena, a very polished computer interface
  to the game.
