# Personal Data Management

## General Purpose File Storage

Store photos and others things I interact with regularly in Google Drive/Photos.
Mirror this to a hard drive I own via the Google Drive app for windows.

Every 2 months store a google takeout backup on two hard drives I own.
Store other "cold storage" items there as well.

When Google Drive releases a 500GB pricing tier (or lowers the price of the 2TB
tier), just store everything in Google Drive.
