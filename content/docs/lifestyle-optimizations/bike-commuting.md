# Bike Commuting


## Benefits

Exercise is good for you, especially when regularly done. If you have to go to
work every day, it makes sense to couple that mandatory travel with exercise to
make the exercise "mandatory" itself!

## Buying a Bike

I personally recommend buying a cheap, used bike for commuting. There are
several reasons for this:

 - Maintaining an expensive bike's high performance can itself be expensive and
   time consuming, especially if you ride it a lot, which you would be doing if
   you are commuting. A cheaper bike with worse performance will require less
   maintenance to keep it at its current performance level, and you can even
   just let it fall into disrepair and get another cheap bike when it becomes
   unusable. This makes the assumption that performance for commuting is not
   that important (it isn't for me).
 - It's easier to buy multiple bikes if they are cheap, which has several
   benefits:
    - You can try out different styles of bike and/or bikes with different
      features over a longer time window.
    - If one bike has a problem that might take a couple days to resolve (e.g.
      if you are waiting for a part delivery), you still have a bike to use.
 - Bike theft is a real problem, and having a used bike (1) makes your bike a
   less attractive target for thieves and (2) makes any theft that does occur
   less painful. AFAIK no lock perfectly secures your bike, and few/no locks
   secure individual bike components.

In a big city like Seattle, there are a lot of people selling bikes, so they
are usually pretty easy to find. I use [craigslist](https://craigslist.org/)
and [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace) for this.

## Rainy Weather

One of the worst parts of bike commuting is getting wet on the way in to work
and not being able to dry off.  For me, most of my cloths dry pretty quickly in
the generally light Seattle rain, but my shoes and socks do not. This is
partially because of their relative thickness and also because they are usually
exposed to the most water. Even when it is not actively raining, biking on wet
ground can toss up a good amount of water on- or into my shoes.

I've found the best solution to this problem by far is wearing some kind of
waterproof shoe covers like [these](https://amzn.to/3NvMFMK).

## Maintenance

### Flat Tires

I like to keep a couple tubes (like [this one](https://amzn.to/3qN1r87)) around
for an easy change.

### Chain Stretching
