## Socks

I have pretty large feet with I think a larger than average instep.
Because of this, I have long struggled to find socks that aren't uncomfortably
tight on the top of my foot.
I have ordered and returned many many socks in search of a pair that feels loose
and comfortable.

I haven't fully found the best socks yet, but the best ones so far have been:

I have actually cut holes in the top of my socks just about at the ankle to help
alleiviate this problem.  It does work.

## Shoes

I started trying out minimalist running shoes when building a running habit
during the pandemic, and these fit me really well and were cheap.
I especially like how loose they are - I think I am more sensitive than most to
having an overheated sweaty foot; I hate that feeling.

Most of the time during the day I untie the laces for comfort.  I tie a knot in the end of each lace so that I don't step/trip on them:
