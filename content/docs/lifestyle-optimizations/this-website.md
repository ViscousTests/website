# This Website

This website serves as a useful place to organize and share my thoughts.

Website setup was done using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start) and is hosted using
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  It uses the
[hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme.  Originally, it was
started by copying the example project in the hugo-book repository, and
modifying the pages.  

## Google Analytics

I added Google Analytics to the site via the `googleAnalytics` field in the
`config.yaml` file - the hugo-book theme handles the rest.  I also needed to
make a Google Analytics account with a "Universal Analytics" property as
described at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10269537.  Hugo
doesn't seem to support the newer "Measurement ID" created when making a
standard analytics property.

## Embedding Google Photos

[This website](https://www.labnol.org/embed/google/photos/) makes it easy to
embed Google Photos in my pages so I don't have to host the images myself when
it's less convenient to do so.

## Cool tips to check out for improvements!
