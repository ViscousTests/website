# Being Competitive

Here when I talk about being competitive I mean striving/expecting to improve at
a given activity, usually relative to other people but also potentially relative
to your past self.

Falling into a competitive mindset can lead to a lot of frustration when you see
yourself stagnate or regress.
This can happen even if you are improving because of variance intrinsic to your
activity, or others improving faster than you.

One thing that helps me manage this is reflecting on the fact that human ability
is generally very multidimensional and impacted by many different variables.
This philosophy is already commonly applied to many activities along some axes
like gender, weight class.
However, there are many other dimensions that impact performance:

 - Clothing/shoe choice
 - Drug use
 - Diet composition
 - Supplement use
 - Technique
 - Genetics
 - Age
 - Experience

These dimensions could just as well be used to stratify people into competitive
groups.
When I start thinking about optimizing myself along all these dimensions, I find
that my competitive frustration dampens.
I find that usually I'm internally only trying to compete on a few dimensions,
like willpower.
If I could just take drugs or tune some of these other parameters to improve my
performance, I would feel less satisfied that if I improved via the dimensions I
care about.

The fact that others can outperform me via these dimensions I don't care as much
about makes me feel less bad about being outperformed.
In fact, sometimes I take pride in my performance _in spite_ of my weakness in
dimensions I don't care about.
For example, my ability to (rock) climb routes of a given grade with the
handicap of ratty shoes makes me feel stronger that I would otherwise.
I also feel great when I have early ("beginner's luck"-y) strong performance in
an activity with the handicap of lack of experience.
