## [Flowx](https://www.flowx.io/)

Really cool weather app that is beautiful, elegant in it's interface, and very
informative. I'd say it takes about a week to get used to it, but after that
it's the best weather source I've ever used.

## [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/)

An app that parses recipes out of the cancer that is most recipe websites into
a nicely formatted, simple, ad-free page that you can save. Works by allowing
you to share recipe webpages with the app.
