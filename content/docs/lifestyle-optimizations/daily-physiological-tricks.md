# Daily Physiological Tricks

## Mental

 - Do as much cleaning (e.g. dishwasher loading and emptying) as possible while
   cooking or right before eating.
   Potential hunger and being already moving around makes it much easier to do
   this than after sitting and eating for a while.
 - Try some of [these ideas]({{< relref
   "/docs/mind/things-to-do-when-unmotivated.md" >}}) when feeling
   unfocused/unproductive/writer's blocked.
 - When having a conversation with someone, try to use some of [these concepts]({{< 
   relref "/docs/understanding-the-world/productive-conversations.md" >}})
   to make the discussion more productive.
   
## Physical

 - Eat one plate of food (even a large one), then wait >2 hours before eating
   more.
   It's really easy for me to feel overfull when going for seconds 10 mins after
   eating.
 - If on a "snack train", eat wasabi to try to curb it.
 - Don't eat >1 cup of broccoli in a day, especially if eating a lot of food
   that day.
 - Eat a small, easy to digest breakfast without protein rich foods.
 - Leaning back briefly when pooping can help push poop out.
