# Daily Physiological Tricks

 - Do as much cleaning (e.g. dishwasher loading and emptying) as possible while cooking or right before eating. 
   Potential hunger and being already moving around makes it much easier to do this than after sitting and eating for a while.
 - When feeling unfocused/unproductive/writer's blocked, try:
     - Going for a run or doing any kind of exercise
     - Taking a shower
     - Getting colder in temperature
     - Not eating (being hungry)
     - Taking a nap
 - Eat one plate of food (even a large one), then wait >2 hours before eating more.
   It's really easy for me to feel overfull when going for seconds 10 mins after eating.
 - If on a "snack train", eat wasabi to try to curb it.
 - Don't eat >1 cup of broccoli in a day, especially if eating a lot of food that day.
