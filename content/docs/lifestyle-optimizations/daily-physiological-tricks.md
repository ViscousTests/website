# Daily Physiological Tricks

## Mental

 - Do as much cleaning (e.g. dishwasher loading and emptying) as possible while
   cooking or right before eating.
   Potential hunger and being already moving around makes it much easier to do
   this than after sitting and eating for a while.
 - Try some of [these ideas]({{< relref
   "/docs/mind/things-to-do-when-unmotivated.md" >}}) when feeling
   unfocused/unproductive/writer's blocked.
 - When having a conversation with someone, try to use some of [these concepts]({{< 
   relref "/docs/understanding-the-world/productive-conversations.md" >}})
   to make the discussion more productive.
 - Make sure there is some [slack](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/38-slack) in
   the day.
   
## Physical

 - Eat one plate of food (even a large one), then wait >2 hours before eating
   more.
   It's really easy for me to feel overfull when going for seconds 10 mins after
   eating.
 - If on a "snack train", eat wasabi to try to curb it.
 - Soup broths are a great way to sate hunger without eating too many calories.
   Try dried seaweed as an addition!
 - Don't eat a lot of these foods in a day:
   - broccoli
 - Foods to eat when I want to be productive (e.g. for breakfast/lunch)
   - Leafy greens, carrots, cauliflower, oils, fish
 - Foods to eat when resting:
   - Peanut butter, beans, some grains, bread
 - Try to follow this rough eating schedule:
   - 9am smallish breakfast: greens, carrots, proteins
   - 12-1pm largish lunch: easy to digest carbs, greens, carrots, potatoes, nuts
   - Try not to give in to snacking cravings in the afternoon
   - 7-9pm smallish dinner: grains/beans, harder to digest carbs
     - This later dinner often leads to better sleep for me.
 - Avoid eating a lot of protein in the evening to get [better temperature
   regulation when sleeping]({{< relref "/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md"
   >}}).
   If it's really cold, do the opposite to stay warm.
 - Leaning back briefly when pooping can help push poop out.
 - Coffee (decaf) bad, especially in the morning.  Green tea good.
