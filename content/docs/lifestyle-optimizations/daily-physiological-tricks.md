# Daily Physiological Tricks

## Mental

 - When feeling overwhelmed or incapable of doing something hard (or even
   understanding what to do!), try disconnecting from new (distracting) stimuli
   (phone, PC) and letting my mind wander.
   - See also [these ideas]({{< relref
     "/docs/mind/things-to-do-when-unmotivated.md" >}}) for other things to do.
 - When something interesting happens, take a note [in
   mementodb](https://github.com/kovasap/autojournal-on-gas?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-tracking).
 - When having a conversation with someone, try to use some of [these
   concepts]({{< relref
   "/docs/understanding-the-world/productive-conversations.md" >}}) to make the
   discussion more productive.
 - Make sure there is some [slack](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/38-slack) in
   the day.
   
## Physical

 - Leaning back briefly when pooping can help push poop out.

## Food

 - Avoid eating a lot of protein in the evening to get [better temperature
   regulation when sleeping]({{< relref "/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md"
   >}}).
   If it's really cold, do the opposite to stay warm.
 - Eat one plate of food (even a large one), then wait >2 hours before eating
   more.
   It's really easy for me to feel overfull when going for seconds 10 mins after
   eating.
 - If on a "snack train", eat wasabi to try to curb it.
 - Soup broths are a great way to sate hunger without eating too many calories.
   Try dried seaweed as an addition!
 - Don't eat a lot of these foods in a day (to avoid feeling bloated / overfull):
   - broccoli

### Food Priority List

When given the option, try to pick foods towards the top of the list:

 - Fish / Seafood
 - Leafy Greens
 - Brassicas (brussel sprouts, etc.)
 - Eggs
 - Peanuts / Legumes

### Old / Obselete?

 - Foods to eat when resting / zoning out:
   - Peanut butter, beans, some grains, bread
   - Going too hard here can lead to low energy for longer than intended (even ~a day).
 - Try to follow this rough eating schedule:
   - 9am small breakfast: light salad (not very much fruit)
   - 12-1pm largish lunch: easy to digest carbs, greens, carrots, potatoes, nuts, fats
   - Try not to give in to snacking cravings in the afternoon
   - 7-9pm smallish dinner: whole grains/beans, less fruit, less fats
     - This later dinner with whole grains specifically often leads to better sleep for me.
 - Coffee (decaf) bad, especially in the morning.
   Green tea good.
   Both are OK right after lunch.
   - Not sure if caffeine at all is a net positive for me anymore.
