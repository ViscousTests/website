# Writing

Note that I am talking here primarily about writing to explore ideas, as
opposed to only entertain.

## Why?

It's easy to convince yourself that your thoughts make sense when they are in
your own head.
By expressing them in writing or conversation their flaws become more clear,
and it's easier to improve upon them.

## Getting Started

Try talking to someone (or yourself) about your topic, recording the
conversation, then using speech-to-text technology to fill your blank page with
a first draft.

Also try:

1. Reading or listening to conversations (e.g. podcasts) about your topic.
1. Going for a run listening to nothing and thinking about your topic.
1. Speech to text when you get home.
1. Edit
