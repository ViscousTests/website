# Task Tracking

## The Problem

I find it quite mentally draining to hold multiple to-do items in my head while
at the same time doing other things. Not only is it tiring, but I frequently
fail at it; some of the tasks will just evaporate from my memory, only to be
recalled a day later (or when there is a serious problem stemming from the task
not being done). This isn't helped by "trying harder". Doing so only makes me
"panic-remember" a task every 5 minutes or so, pulling me completely out of
whatever else I was doing.

Trying to remember tasks I've found also has a large negative impact on my
sleep quality. The cycle of "panic-remembering" leads to me sleeping lightly
and waking up whenever the remembering happens.

## Mobile Reminders

An amazing solution to my above problem has been using reminders on my
smartphone to keep tasks out of my head, but still make sure they are done. I
personally use Google Tasks, but I'm sure other reminder apps would work just
as well. My system works like this:

1. Think of something that needs to be done, or be asked to do something by
   another person.
1. Add a task on my phone with a description of the work.
1. **Set a time on the task when I think I'll be free to tackle it.**
1. Get notified of the task at the time I set.
1. Do the task, or postpone it; or do some work towards the task and postpone
   it for later follow up.

This system works very well compared to e.g. a to-do list, because it
explicitly considers what time I'll be in the right mindset and have the right
context to do each item. I don't need to periodically scan my list and
re-remember every task when figuring out what to do next.

This system also makes it easy to set recurring tasks, or tasks in the far
future (months to years away). I've never been able to consistently remember to
do these kinds of tasks before using this system.

## Building Habits

Setting recurring reminders at specific times is also an extremely effective
way of building [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). I find
that doing this proactively is much better than trying to track adherence to a
habit reactively (e.g. tracking workouts).
