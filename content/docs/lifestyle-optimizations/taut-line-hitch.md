# The Most Useful Knot in the World (Taut-line hitch)

This knot allows you to adjust its location on a string **after** you've tied
it, and it stays in said location even under a lot of force.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taut-line_hitch) for instructions
on how to tie. Some of the many uses I've found for this knot:

 - Tying, then tightening, a clothsline
 - Tying drawstrings on sweatpants or shorts - you never need to untie/retie
   them again!
