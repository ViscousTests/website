# Ad-Free YouTube Viewing

Sometimes YouTube videos are riddled with ads that make them hard to watch. To
combat this issue, I created [a small
script](https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dl-and-play-yt.bash)
that downloads the youtube video at the URL currently on your clipboard and
plays it with your default video player. I made [a
hotkey](https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/1c6706b9df29d8ae7a1f214bb6dcba7474e77d15/.config/qtile/config.py#L158)
to run this scipt in my window manager (QTile). So now when I want to watch a
YouTube video I just need to copy the url to my clipboard and then hit "mod-y"
on my keyboard (mod is the windows key)! This also has the added benefit of
saving the video to my hard drive in case I want to watch it later when
offline.
