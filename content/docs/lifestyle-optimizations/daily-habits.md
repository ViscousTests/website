# Daily Habits

## Food

### Schedule

 - **Breakfast:** Avoid very heavy foods (like lots of oil).
   Not too large; overeating at breakfast is a good way to derail energy for the
   rest of the day.
 - **Lunch:** eat one, but try to wait until hungry again from breakfast.
   This could be 5+ hours later.
   Focus on protein/fat with some carbs like potatoes/grains.
   Eating only fats/greens can lead to low energy and continued hunger.
 - **Dinner:** eat only if hungry OR if I worked out in the afternoon/evening.
   Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, avoid fat and salt!
   This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy,
   digesting fat/salt keeps me awake).
    - *Enforcement mechanism:* I have a calendar event every day starting at
      5:30 that reminds me of this item.

### Staple Foods

 - See [Cooking]({{< relref "/docs/health-and-longevity/cooking.md" >}}).
   Foods here are roughly ranked in the order I consume them.
 - Raw vegetables and fruits for snacking (apples, cabbage)

### Food Reactions

How I personally react to different foods in 2025.

#### Animal Products

 - **Fish:** Often make me feel tired/sleepy when digesting.
   Not great to overeat on.  I like to eat regularly for the omega-3s.
 - **Dairy:** Makes me gassy and generally not feel great.
 - **Eggs:** No issues, although can take longer to digest than other foods; not
 great to eat them if my next meal will be soon.

#### Legumes

 - **Tofu:** No issues digesting.
 - **Beans/Chickpeas/Lentils:** When I eat these plain, I tend to stay hungry for a while
   and eat a lot of them.
   This invariably leads to me feeling very overfull and tired, as they are also
   hard for me to digest.
 - **Peanut Products:** Good in small quantities, but very easy to overdo.
   - **Peanut Butter:** Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many
     hours afterward as I digest.
   - **Peanuts:** Generally make me feel ok when I eat them.
   - **Peanut Protein Powder:** I tolerate this really well even in higher
     quantities, making me think that the oil in peanuts is the main thing I
     react poorly too.

#### Grains

 - **Rolled Oats:** I love oats and even eat them raw.
   I don't have any issues eating/digesting them.
 - **Brown Rice:** Good in small quantities, too much can make me feel bloated.
 - **White Rice:** Similar to brown rice, but I can eat more of it.

#### Fruits

 - **Apples:** No issues here!
 - **Bananas:** For some reason, eating bananas alone can give me a short-lived
   headache and seems to mess with my energy.

#### Vegetables

 - **Pickled Onions:** Upset my stomach.  I should avoid them generally.
 - **Cabbage:** I love cabbage, and it seems to be very easy for me to digest.
 - **Broccoli:** Good in smaller quantities, too much can make me feel bloated.

#### Nuts/Seeds

 - **Nut Butters:** Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many
   hours afterward as I digest.
 - **Chia Seeds:** I love chia seeds and have no issues eating them.
 - **Almonds:** Good, just don't eat too many.
 - **Walnuts:** Good, just don't eat too many.

## Supplements

I take vitamin D and omega-3 fish oil daily.
  - *Enforcement mechanism:* I have a recurring daily task to take these in the
    morning.

## Exercise

### When using a computer

I try to move around regularly, via walking around or doing some light
physical-therapy-style exercises like
https://www.momentumphysicaltherapy.ca/blog/okotoks-physiotherapy-posture-exercises.
  - *Enforcement mechanism:* I have a recurring daily task to do this in the
    afternoon.

## Tasks

All things I need to do should be tracked in a "reminders" task list in Google
Tasks with an associated date/time.
When that date/time occurs, I should get a notification on my phone.
At this point I will immediately either:

1. Do the task or
2. Reset the task date/time for when I think I can do it or
3. Delete the task if it is obselete or
4. Remove the date/time and move the task to another task list like "Stuff to
   Try" (this list has hundreds of items for me that most of which I will likely
   never do).

I should never have any task notifications "sitting around" or any obselete tasks.

One of the reasons why this works so well for me is that I often look down at my
phone when I am bored or in between tasks.
This is the perfect time to do or reassign tasks; otherwise I would likely just
browse Reddit.

This applies for recurring tasks as well: if I get a recurring task that I want
to do later, I will mark it as complete, then make a new task with the new name
with a different date/time.

## Lifelogging

See more at [Lifelogging / What and Why]({{< relref "/docs/lifelogging/what-and-why.md" >}}).

Try to write a couple notes of what happened during the day in my momentodb
activity journal, which syncs to [this Google
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nZ-iliU7MtRPoAdP-HbjBees6u3-NIlicHRfewD0Q7A/edit?gid=1108618816#gid=1108618816).
I specifically try to note at least one thing about work, and one other thing.

*Enforcement mechanism:* I have a recurring daily task to do this.

TODO: try making my own version of https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/ based on my
activity log data.
It should be possible to do this by writing a script that downloads activity log
data from the google sheet with the `gdrive` command line tool and formats it to
the proper format for the weeks website.
