# Daily Habits

## Food

 - **Breakfast:** eat a somewhat large one, with a focus on protein/fat and
   maybe some carbs.
 - **Lunch:** eat one, but try to wait until hungry again from breakfast.
   This could be 5+ hours later.
   Focus on protein/fat with some carbs like potatoes/grains.
   If eating desserts during the day, eat them now.
 - **Dinner:** eat only if hungry.
   Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, avoid fat.
   This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy,
   digesting fat/protein keeps me awake).
    - *Enforcement mechanism:* I have a calendar event every day starting at
      5:30 that reminds me of this item.

## Tasks

All things I need to do should be tracked in a "reminders" task list in Google Tasks with an associated date/time.  When that date/time occurs, I should get a notification on my phone.  At this point I will immediately either:

1. Do the task or
2. Reset the task date/time for when I think I can do it or
3. Delete the task if it is obselete or
4. Remove the date/time and move the task to another task list like "Stuff to Try"

I should never have any task notifications "sitting around" or any obselete tasks.

This applies for recurring tasks as well: if I get a recurring task that I want
to do later, I will mark it as complete, then make a new task with the new name
with a different date/time.

## Lifelogging

Try to write a couple notes of what happened during the day in my momentodb
activity journal, which syncs to [this Google
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nZ-iliU7MtRPoAdP-HbjBees6u3-NIlicHRfewD0Q7A/edit?gid=1108618816#gid=1108618816).

*Enforcement mechanism:* I have a recurring daily task to do this.
