# Daily Habits

## Food

See [Personal Food Habits]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/personal-food-habits.md" >}}).

## Supplements

See [Supplements]({{< relref "/docs/health-and-longevity/food/supplements.md" >}}).

## Exercise

### When using a computer

I try to move around regularly, via walking around or doing some light
physical-therapy-style exercises like
https://www.momentumphysicaltherapy.ca/blog/okotoks-physiotherapy-posture-exercises.

## Tasks

All things I need to do should be tracked in a "reminders" task list in Google
Tasks with an associated date/time.
When that date/time occurs, I should get a notification on my phone.
At this point I will immediately either:

1. Do the task or
2. Reset the task date/time for when I think I can do it or
3. Delete the task if it is obsolete or
4. Remove the date/time and move the task to another task list like "Stuff to
   Try" (this list has hundreds of items for me that most of which I will likely
   never do).

I should never have any task notifications "sitting around" or any obsolete tasks.

One of the reasons why this works so well for me is that I often look down at my
phone when I am bored or in between tasks.
This is the perfect time to do or reassign tasks; otherwise I would likely just
browse Reddit.

This applies for recurring tasks as well: if I get a recurring task that I want
to do later, I will mark it as complete, then make a new task with the new name
with a different date/time.

## Lifelogging

See more at [Lifelogging / What and Why]({{< relref "/docs/lifelogging/what-and-why.md" >}}).

Try to write a couple notes of what happened during the day in my momentodb
activity journal, which syncs to [this Google
Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nZ-iliU7MtRPoAdP-HbjBees6u3-NIlicHRfewD0Q7A/edit?gid=1108618816#gid=1108618816).
I specifically try to note at least one thing about work, and one other thing.

*Enforcement mechanism:* I have a recurring daily task to do this.

TODO: try making my own version of https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/ based on my
activity log data.
It should be possible to do this by writing a script that downloads activity log
data from the google sheet with the `gdrive` command line tool and formats it to
the proper format for the weeks website.
