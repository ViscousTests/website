## March

 - Terra Mystica on BGA and in person
 - Writing lots of SQL at work

   wealth inequality.
   Guy is charismatic, but a bit vague - a dangerous but entertaining combo!
 - Saw Russian Circles live at the showbox.
   Incredible!
 - Windows crashed during an update, prompted me to try going 100% Linux going
   forward.  Working surprisingly well.
 - Tried Due Process, good first impression!
 - Dark and Darker and FTL: Multiverse continue to be amazing.
