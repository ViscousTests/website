# Recent Interests

Here I list stuff I've been interested in recently.
I try to update this monthly, using a recurring task to help.

## 2025

## March

 - Terra Mystica on BGA and in person
 - Writing lots of SQL at work
 - Read Gary Stevenson's book about his life and watched a bunch of videos about
   wealth inequality.
   Guy is charismatic, but a bit vague - a dangerous but entertaining combo!
 - Saw Russian Circles live at the showbox.
   Incredible!
 - Windows crashed during an update, prompted me to try going 100% Linux going
   forward.  Working surprisingly well.
 - Tried Due Process, good first impression!
 - Dark and Darker and FTL: Multiverse continue to be amazing.

## April

 - Started playing The Bazaar with Claire.
   Really fun, if a bit tiring to do a single run all at once.
 - Watched a bunch of Dave MacLeod videos and tried out a mostly meat diet.
   It felt pretty good at first, but less good over time.
   I think I'd need to be particularly motivated to try it more purely for an
   extended period of time.
 - Had a bunch of computer issues to debug.
   Namely some black screen crashes when playing cleric in Dark and Darker(which
   I think were fixed by decreasing particle count in a custom `Engine.ini`
   file), and some slowness with The Last Spell which prompted me to upgrade my
   cpu (which didn't seem to help :().
 - Still writing lots of SQL at work.
   Had a brutal bug to debug where function arguments were being overwritten by
   aliased column names in a query.
 - Checked out Taskmaster and Ted Lasso, both pretty great in their own ways
 - Played a bunch of Tarkir: Dragonflight draft first in person then on MTG:
   Arena.
