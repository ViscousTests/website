# Recent Interests

Here I list stuff I've been interested in recently.
I try to update this monthly, using a recurring task to help.
I probably forget a lot of things that happen each month :(.

To populate this page, try using my mementodb diary, and

## March

 - Terra Mystica on BGA and in person
 - Writing lots of SQL at work
 - Read Gary Stevenson's book about his life and watched a bunch of videos about
   wealth inequality.
   Guy is charismatic, but a bit vague - a dangerous but entertaining combo!
 - Saw Russian Circles live at the showbox.
   Incredible!
 - Windows crashed during an update, prompted me to try going 100% Linux going
   forward.  Working surprisingly well.
 - Tried Due Process, good first impression!
 - Dark and Darker and FTL: Multiverse continue to be amazing.

## April

 - Started playing The Bazaar with Claire.
   Really fun, if a bit tiring to do a single run all at once.
 - Watched a bunch of Dave MacLeod videos and tried out a mostly meat diet.
   It felt pretty good at first, but less good over time.
   I think I'd need to be particularly motivated to try it more purely for an
   extended period of time.
 - Had a bunch of computer issues to debug.
   Namely some black screen crashes when playing cleric in Dark and Darker(which
   I think were fixed by decreasing particle count in a custom `Engine.ini`
   file), and some slowness with The Last Spell which prompted me to upgrade my
   cpu (which didn't seem to help :().
 - Still writing lots of SQL at work.
   Had a brutal bug to debug where function arguments were being overwritten by
   aliased column names in a query.
 - Checked out Taskmaster and Ted Lasso, both pretty great in their own ways
 - Played a bunch of Tarkir: Dragonflight draft first in person then on MTG:
   Arena.

## May

 - V Rising
 - Epic saga trying to debug my computer not sleeping after replacing CPU:
   https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=2244784#p2244784
 - Send long term black 5.12+ project at the IMA crags
 - Started going out climbing at the exits again, feeling strong!
 - Started running to/from work, way better than I expected.
 - Started working in neuroscience research project https://github.com/kovasap/nightly-nwb
 - Started working on new drafting game idea https://github.com/kovasap/draft-concept
 - Got back into R6: siege a bit

## June

 - Switched to AMD GPU and better AMD CPU.
   Fixed my computer sleep problem finally, and struggled a bit to get the new
   CPU to stay cool with low fan noise.
 - Dark and Darker content creator drama (NotLikeThis/Soma).
 - Learned how to use syncthing to manage music between PC and Android.
   Really impressive piece of software!
 - Spent a lot of time on https://github.com/kovasap/draft-concept, making
   progress, but also shifting things around a lot.
 - Working version of https://github.com/kovasap/nightly-nwb created!
 - Lots of attempts on Rainy Day Woman at World Wall.
   Very close, but still a hard route.
   Need to be better about finding and trusting footholds, and then remembering
   them.
 - Ark Nova is fun.
 - Ate a bunch of iceberg lettuce salads.
   E.g.
   tortilla chips/mayo/lettuce/shredded carrots.
 - Selling old Pokemon cards I discovered.  Quite a labor intensive process to price and sell them all.
 - The Bazaar continues to be great!

I'm trying to continue tracking my interests via updates to individual pages on
this site; see recent edit history!
