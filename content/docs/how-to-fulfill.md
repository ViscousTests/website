# Living a Positive, Fulfilling Life

## Why Be Positive?

Infectious: positive/fulfilled people inspire others to be positive/fulfilled.

Definitely helps you build friendships and romantic relationships.

## Low Impact Factors

 - Changing personal life circumstances (e.g. salary)


## High Impact Factors: Gratifications

## High Impact Factors: Attainment

I am motivated by attainment.  My mind/body strive to attain:

 - security (state of knowing my basic needs are at hand)
 - understanding
 - efficiency for myself
 - efficiency for others

Be wary of attempting to attain the unattainable.  Grand truths and unifying
philosophies are tempting goals, but can lead to extreme frustration or, worse,
acceptance of a false conclusion just to reach attainment.


## Positive, Fulfilling Actions

Actions that are positive and fulfilling are usually personally engaging, and
have some long lasting impact.

### Examples

#### Indoor Climbing

Requires active learning of sequences of actions that constantly change.

Accomplishment feels satisfying.  It:
 - Validates a personal physical capability (I can do this, and here is proof).
 - Demonstrates ability to peers.
 - Requires physical and mental focus/attention to achieve.


#### Magic Arena



## Self-sufficiency

I want my life to be full of good emotions.  I feel good emotions when I attain
something I find important.  This could be:

 - understanding that makes life easier
 - giving understanding successfully to someone to make their life easier
 - a resource that I need to survive (food, water, money)
 - comfort
 - an ability/performance that I don't always have

The attainment of these things comes most reliably from myself.  I am very
confident in my ability to attain stuff, or at least to work out how to attain
it.  Relying on others to help me attain things I find important (that they
might not) is usually less reliable that just doing it myself.  

Usually involving others in my life is an augmentation to what I currently do.
I feel scared and insecure when I need to depend on others to feel positive
emotions.  I'm ok with people just boosting my emotions, but when they are the
source of an emotion I depend on I become insecure.



## Emotions (and Relationships)

Good points about rationalization:

If someone has a strong model in their head for how things should go (certain
expectations) with an additional expectation that others will help make that
model a reality, it can lead to conflict.

It always takes some effort for the helper to understand what the expector
wants, but this is exacerbated if the request is ambiguous.  People do not
respond well to situations where a high pressure is placed on them that they do
not know how to resolve.

## Satisfaction

Happiness is an emotion.  I

Emotions are reactions to changes in perception of environment.
Therefore, to spark happiness, you must see your environment as better than it
was before somehow.  


## Fulfillment


## Inter-societal support

One way to look at people's path through life is with the following gradient:

On one extreme, people start life with a blank slate of skills/interests
and can choose what skills to hone or interests to pursue.

On the other, people's potential skills and interests are either pre-baked into
them or life is set up such that they have no control over what skills and
interests they will ultimately have.

In the first case, people have agency over how much value they contribute to
society and also how much value they capture for themselves.  
In the second, people do not, and therefore it may be right for those richer
than them to support them financially or with other resources.
