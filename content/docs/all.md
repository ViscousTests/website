# All Notes

## (Home) Energy Monitoring

This is a project I haven't completed yet, but want to. 
The ultimate goal is to get a realtime datafeed of total home power
usage, so I can have more direct feedback to how my appliance usage
effects power consumption....

## 2025 Lifelogging Update

Someone on Reddit working on developing a new lifelogging product reached out to
me to help guide their work.
Here are my responses to their survey on March 28, 2025:...

## 3-in-1 Phone Case

This system for a wallet, keys, and phone in one package has been serving me
pretty well.  It doesn't add much noticeable bulk to my phone at all, and even
makes it a bit easier to hold because my fingers can grab the pouch instead of
the other side of the phone....

## Actionable Tips to Improve Code

Here are various specific and actionable things you can try out to improve code
quality (and/or challenge yourself)....

## Ad-Free YouTube Viewing

Sometimes YouTube videos are riddled with ads that make them hard to watch. To
combat this issue, I created [a small
script](https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/dl-and-play-yt.bash)
that downloads the youtube video at the URL currently on your clipboard and
plays it with your default video player. I made [a
hotkey](https://github.com/kovasap/dotfiles/blob/1c6706b9df29d8ae7a1f214bb6dcba7474e77d15/.config/qtile/config.py#L158)
to run this scipt in my window manager (QTile). So now when I want to watch a
YouTube video I just need to copy the url to my clipboard and then hit "mod-y"
on my keyboard (mod is the windows key)! This also has the added benefit of
saving the video to my hard drive in case I want to watch it later when
offline....

## Applying Theories

**NOTE: This is a very rough draft, and in some ways doesn't really make sense
: )**...

## Artificial Intelligence

Reading Chapter 7 (Artificial Creativity) of "The Beginning of Infinity" by
David Deutsch gave me some ideas for things to try out WRT creating some kind
of artificial intelligence....

## Auto Input Data Collection

Frequently when I am debugging code, I will make some changes to a single
function, then re-run tests that call my function as well as many others above
it in the stack. If there are few large tests, they make take a long time doing
lots of computations that I don't care about in the process of testing my
function....

## Avoiding Accidents

Accidents are a common cause of death (ranked 3rd, 6% of total deaths in 2019).
These further break down into categories:...

## Baking

...

## Bananagrams

One fun variant is to open a book in text format with some program that can search text and make it so that you can only use words that exist in that book....

## Beat Saber

Playing the VR rhythm game beat saber....

## Behavior Change

Building new habits is really important to making permanent improvement to your
life.  Doing new things is hard though.  One thing that helps me work through
this is realizing that every new thing (no matter how trivial) is going to be
difficult, and I'll need to sculpt the pathways in my brain to make it easy....

## Being Competitive

Here when I talk about being competitive I mean striving/expecting to improve at
a given activity, usually relative to other people but also potentially relative
to your past self....

## Brain Juice

I'm not sure exactly how, but I feel that my brain behaves similarly to my
muscles in that it can tire on both short and long timescales when used.  My
mind feels tired after making lots of new connections (learning new things) and
especially when critically re-validating my existing connections. It also feels
tired when doing the same thing many times, even if that thing is a simple
expression of a deeply ingrained skill....

## Cancelling Highly Productive People

Unfortunately, it seems like some highly productive people that have
permanently improved the lives of millions of people are also either not very
socially aware and/or are downright abusive to their colleagues. Often this
leads to allegations of harassment (sexual or otherwise), and a removal of the
person from their position....

## Causes of Death

To avoid death, it's helpful to know what will most likely cause it....

## Character Alignment Visualization

If a character in an RPG becomes more intelligent, strong, or aligned with a
particular element, their color (or background color) could be hue-shifted to
reflect this. This would make it easier to at-a-glance determine more about
different characters in the game. This would additionally provided some "woah"
factor if you come across a character with a particularly strong (saturated)
color aura....

## Chess

I play my chess on [lichess.org](https://www.lichess.org), which has a great UI and cool analysis features....

## Choosing a Language

When deciding what programming language to use, there are several important
factors:...

## Chronic Stress

## Circadian Rhythm

https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/...

## Clairvoyant Turn Based Tactics

Instead of guessing or assuming what the computer opponent will do in a turn
based tactics game like fire emblem or xcom, have the current move of the
opponent always displayed on screen.  To be more precise, show the exact
movement and actions of all enemy units that would take place if the player
ended their turn right now.  As the player plans out their moves, update the
enemy moves that would happen if the player committed to their current plan.
This should lead to a very tight feedback look as the player gets constant
updates as the move their movement selection from tile to tile....

## Climbing Safety Checklist

At time of writing, I recently finished reading [*The Checklist
Manifesto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto) by Atul
Gawande.  This book makes the strong point that human beings are not inherently
perfectly disciplined, and will inevitably cut corners when doing a task many
times.  This is especially true when the corners that are cut are usually not
important, even if sometimes they are crucially so....

This game was pretty mindless but at least it let me [make a YouTube video with 160k views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx1vtMZCFvI&ab_channel=s1lentProtector)....

## Communal Living

In media like [Everyday Utopia]({{< relref "/docs/books/everyday-utopia.md"
>}}), communal living situations are brought up as a way to help people get a
better sense of community and lead happier lives.
Why then do many people not live this way?...

## Comparing prices

When buying a good or service, comparing many alternatives to find the best price. For example, looking at the price per pound of various grocery items and picking the one with the lowest price....

## Complexity

A killer of productivity (and fun)....

## Contentment and Satisfaction

> At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, Kurt Vonnegut informs his pal, Joseph Heller, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel Catch-22 over its whole history.

## Drafting Magic: The Gathering

My first experience was 'that complex card game that older kids played' when I
was very young.
Faintly remember that I specifically thought the lands were really cool, have
specific memory of the plains.
Started playing first from a friend's cube (a collection of cards you can draft
decks from and then play each other in a tournament style).
Was pretty intense/overwhelming at first, but in a good way.
Since have played a bunch on MTG: Arena, a very polished computer interface to
the game....

events you will have to contend with in the future....

## Freedom, Inequality, and Meritocracy

I was listening to the rational reminder financial podcast and they had [an
episode about financial
literacy](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXRpb25hbHJlbWluZGVyLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/ZjQyYThmNjktZjhiMC00MzFmLTk0NzQtM2EwZTY2ODc0ZTk5?ep=14)
and one of the statistics they mentioned was 30 to 40% of retirement savings can
be explained by financial literacy alone.
If true, it’s kind of crazy to think that a large fraction of the financial
inequality in at least the United States or wherever the study was done is due
to financial literacy....

## Friendship

One way to look at a friend is as someone who cares about your in-the-moment
emotional state, and wants to participate in improving it.
This is as opposed to someone who cares more about your long term emotions,
which would be more of a coach or mentor....

## Gerrymandering

In the US, a mostly agreed upon problem is that our legislative districts are
drawn in a biased way which favors whichever party was in power when the lines
were last drawn.
This is easy because geographical boundaries are pretty arbitrary, and IMO do a
bad job of sorting people into representable groups.
So there isn't really a way to judge the quality of the lines as they are drawn....

Everyone you are working with will have a model in their heads that describes

models out of their heads so that others can amend their own models in an
effort to reach some kind of consensus.  This is hard work and is not always
treated as such....

## Iratus: Lord of the Dead

I get the feeling that this game is trying too hard.
It (IMO) has too many mechanics and stats that don't seem to be that
consequential.
There's also a lot to manage; a lot of small decisions need to be made that
don't seem to really individually matter that much.
It's as if the developers were constantly focused on adding more content to the
game and not on the impact/consequence of that content to the strategy the
player develops as they play....

## Limiting Collaboration

In several turn-based collaborative multiplayer games I've played
(_Gloomhaven_, _Pandemic_, _Divinity Original Sin 2_), I've noticed a common
issue that draws out what would otherwise be a more streamlined experience.
This is that, while these games usually have players control specific
characters, in reality what happens is that the playgroup as a whole decides on
the best move that everyone should take. Then everyone just makes the agreed
upon move. This effectively turns a "multiplayer" game into a complex "single
player" experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to
consensus. Another way to say this is that the game starts getting **"played by
committee"**....

## Listening to Books

When commuting I like to listen to podcasts or books for learning and
entertainment. Unfortunately, many books do not have audiobook versions.
Luckily, it's fairly easy to use text-to-speech engines to convert the text of
e books into audio.  See tools in this repo:

In October 2023 I decided to finally test out some high refresh rate monitors

I tried three and definitely noticed the higher refresh rate even when moving

In games I noticed it as well.
I noticed it the most in R6: Siege, probably because my graphics card (GTX 1060)
could get up to 90 FPS in that game.
This differerence was very significant.

## Personal Specific Food Notes

## Perspective

One way to think about perspective is as the narrative you tell yourself about
the world.
I think that perspective really strongly shapes more than anything else your
experience and even your abilities, because the way you think about the world
and the way you conceptualize it informs your behavior directly.
The information we get from our senses is full of holes and is just generally
imperfect.
Our mind has to construct a coherent perspective out of that to act upon, so
given the same inputs there are many many very valid perspectives to take from
them....

## Physical "Breaking Point"

One interesting thing I've noticed about myself as I progress through a

## Productive Conversations

 - Start with "what would convince you that you're wrong?"
 - Talk about how specific possibilities make you feel, then try to pin down
   why.
   This can lead to identifying more specific concerns that may not be the same
   as the initial point of argument.
 - Don't change the subject or gloss over a point until it is resolved.
   Especially don't counter a point with something unrelated.
 - Make sure the objective of the conversation is crystal clear to all parties
   (state it explicitly).
 - Ask people to explain how the thing that's being discussed works (objectively).

## Random Balance

It would be interesting to play a PvP game where every match/day/week, random
adjustments were made to the stats of in game objects (cards, items, etc.).
This would make a big part of the game trying to understand what is strong this
session, as it always changes.
This could lead to less staleness overall, and avoid the problem many games have where some strategies are perennially weak and never get used....

## Random Ideas

A collection of random short ideas I've had over the years that I haven't
executed on (yet). If you find or do one of these things let me know!...

## Random Technologies

For a management or economic game, make new technologies randomly get discovered at a rate proportional to the player's "research power" (the resources they put towards research).
One cool way to make this work is to have a hidden dependency web (e.g.
fire must be discovered before cooking), and then randomly select a tech to be discovered from the set of all techs that have had all their dependencies discovered.
This would force the player to adapt to the consequences of what their people discover, and make the game more dynamic and replayable....

## Real Time Strategy

One big issue I have with real time economic simulation games ([Offworld Trading
Company]({{< relref "/docs/games/Offworld-Trading-Company.md" >}}),
[Rimworld]({{< relref "/docs/games/Rimworld.md" >}}), [Oxygen Not Included]({{<
relref "/docs/games/oxygen-not-included.md" >}})) is that there is often a
period of the game where you are just waiting for resources to accumulate or for
some random event to happen.
This IMO is a really bad experience because (1) it's boring and (2) it puts the
player in a more reactive frame of mind.
Turn based games sidestep this problem....

There are those who corrupt their own moral standing to benefit society:...

## Shelter In The Storm

Sometimes it feels accurate to describe the world as a raging storm that drains
your wealth as your stand in it.
The only way to survive is to find pockets of shelter that shield you from this
drain and build you up for any future forays into the storm.
These pockest are most commonly jobs, but could also be self constructed passive
income systems....

## Sleep

Some tips and tricks that work for me to get better sleep....

## Social Games

I used to play Team Fortress 2 on a specific server (OSU) with a list of
regular players.  Over time I started recognizing these players, which led to a
natural community forming. This community led to some of my most memorable
gaming experiences, which I haven't been able to replicate with today's
convenient but faceless matchmaking systems....

## Socializing

...

## Solving Societal Problems

Here I'm defining a "societal problem" as a large problem facing many people
that could be solved if said people changed their behavior in some systematic
way. For example:...

## States of Mind

These states can be mixed together, but are at their strongest when the mind is
fully focused on one at a time....

## The Most Useful Knot in the World (Taut-line hitch)

it, and it stays in said location even under a lot of force....

## Trading Card MMORPG

In my experience one of the biggest strengths of an MMORPG is the player driven
economy and the interactions with other players that the economy forces.  Often
 I think the gameplay of an MMORPG - what you actually do most of the time - is one of its weaker points.
  For example quests like kill x monsters or collect x objects can be very tedious....

## Utopian Idea Management

As touched on in [Utopia]({{< relref "/docs/society/utopia.md" >}}), in my
opinion the concept that people can "own" any form of information and have sole
right to profit off of it is deeply problematic to me....

## Vim Tricks

## Watching GothamChess

Watching the GothamChess YouTube channel....

## Watching Inside Out

I loved the modelling of the mind as a collection of different emotions competing for control. Really made me get invested with the main character, and made me cry when things started going poorly for her at one point. Discussing this movie might be a good way to connect with people that are otherwise fairly different. ...

## Watching Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse

Great story, cool themes about family and parenting. Also about self discovery. Quintessential all-ages kind of film....

## Watching The Matrix

Watched with my Dad after being told that it would be very hard to understand. Turned out that wasn't true for either of us. Excellent sci-fi, where sci-fi is defined as a medium that explores how new plausible technologies would affect the world. Action/style was very compelling to. Favorite movie for many years, perhaps even still in some ways. I think the sequels are pretty good, unlike many others....

## Watching educational YouTube

This includes watching videos from channels like [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium), [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey), and [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)....

## Wavelength or [Longwave](https://longwave.web.app/)

An icebreaker-type game that revolves around guessing people's opinions....

## What standard of thought should we expect from people?

I recently read *What's Our Problem* by Tim Urban, where he makes the case that
many of our current societal divisions are caused by more primitive parts of our
minds dominating the conversation.
He argues that our "higher minds" that are capable of considering many
conflicting perspectives to seek truth should instead be driving the
conversation.
Specifically, Tim argues that all perspectives should be open to higher-minded
discussion and shutting down discussion on certain topics is dangerously
illiberal....

## What to Believe

In order to make good decisions, people need to build an understanding of how
the world works by gathering information.
Luckily, it is getting easier and easier to do this as technology becomes more
and more efficient at sending data around the world.
Unfortunately, simply gathering information is not enough; one must also make
sure that the information is of high enough quality to use in world modeling or
decision making....

## Why Foods Are "Unhealthy"

...

## Working With Complex Systems

Systems of a sufficient complexity are hard/impossible to intuitively reason
about, or become an expert in.
One way to think about these systems is as "low validity environments" as
described in [the Veritasium video on
experts](https://youtu.be/5eW6Eagr9XA?t=321)....

opposed to only entertain....

Using a bike to fulfill daily transportation needs. Best with combined with audiobooks or podcasts....

## [Codenames](https://codenames.game/)

One variant worth trying is trying to play with pictures instead of words on the main board. A stand-alone game (Codenames Pictures) exists for this, but it's also fun to try using custom pictures. For instance, the dream cards from Mysterium led to a pretty fun game. Note that [this site](https://codenames-pictures.dport.me/) looks like it allows you to do this in a virtual setting....

Excellent book that addresses (a theory for) how knowledge is created and the
implications that has for humankind, and "people" more generally. David's
theory is that knowledge is created by filtering many creative conjectures into
those that give the best explanations for things via a tradition of criticism....

### Influences

- [Getting things done by Johnathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCzrKjbXZQY)
  - Depth first approach to problem solving can be bad because you end up going
    in the wrong direction (which you would have avoided going breath-first)
- [Hammock Driven Development by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)
  - Stepping back from a problem and doing other things or sleeping allows
    unconscious parts of your mind draw connections that you otherwise wouldn't
    draw.  This allows you to solve problems that otherwise would be much harder
    or impossible.
- [Thinking Above the Code by Leslie Lamport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4Yp3j_jk8Q)
  - It is easy to trick yourself that you are thinking rationally when you do
    not share your thoughts by writing them down or speaking them out loud.  If
    you are serious about solving a problem, write down your thought process!
- [Things You Should Never Do by Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)
  - Rewriting code is tempting, but can destroy solutions to many
    micro-problems that are hard to see from the top level.
- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/)
  - A good reality check on being practical when programming, and being honest
    with oneself about how things are actually working.
 - [Cognitive load is what matters](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42489645)
   - A framework for thinking about what organizational systems to adopt in your code....
