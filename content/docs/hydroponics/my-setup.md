# My Hydroponics Setup

## Overview Presentation

I gave a rough overview of my interest in hydroponics for some colleagues at
work; see [my
slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ld4dWkpqrHlZe9BtNFHWjIHNZ1D6AGCyu9sLCiGeSg/edit?usp=sharing)
for a summary.

## Goals

My [diet goals](/docs/eating/food.md) suggest that I eat a lot of leafy greens.
Unfortunately, these greens do not keep well and are somewhat expensive to buy.
Therefore, they are at the highest risk (out of all foods I want to eat) of not
being eaten simply because they are not around.  

Luckily, leafy greens are some of the easiest plants to grow hydroponically,
and hydroponic systems provide one of the easiest ways to grow plants.

## Method

Most leafy greens should take [about a
month](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/quick-growing-plants-hydroponic-systems-27438.html#:~:text=best%20for%20you.-,Lettuce,ready%20as%20the%20leafy%20types.)
to grow hydroponically.  Therefore, if I want to eat two plants a day, I need
60 plant growing stations in my system.  This is a 10x6 system, which seems
fairly small actually.

The [Kratky method](https://university.upstartfarmers.com/blog/kratky-method)
provides a simple and easy (no moving parts) method to grow, and seems to be
effective for the leafy greens I want to grow.

I want to use grow lights to keep my setup consistent.  LED lights have fairly
low power consumption anyway (~20W per light).

## My Materials List

 - Grow lights [$30/2ft](https://www.amazon.com/Byingo-2ft-Plant-Grow-Light/dp/B0792P3YPQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1543443557&sr=8-4&keywords=24%22+grow+light&&linkCode=sl1&tag=growjourney-20&linkId=8ef750b460d78406d53989694159a1f4&language=en_US), maybe [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKF6BT4/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AHA091K9FJYEL&th=1)?
 - Net pots [50/$8](https://www.amazon.com/xGarden-Lightweight-Economy-Hydroponics-Aquaponics/dp/B07W9H8ZRH/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=net+cups&qid=1608176074&sr=8-6)
 - Perlite
 - Vermiculite or peat moss
 - Wire Rack [$50](https://www.amazon.com/Seville-Classics-5-Tier-Shelving-Wheels/dp/B00CL9204C/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&keywords=wire+rack+shelf&qid=1608176180&sr=8-13)

To make things easy, it would be cool to come up with a reusable solution for
the material to plant the seeds in, since I would be harvesting and replanting
2 per day.  Could use [mixture of course soils](https://youtu.be/jYOlzqIq9OM)
for this!

## Seed Generation - not done yet!

It would be cool to have a separate growing bin in a warmer place where plants
would go to seed.  This way I could generate my own seeds and not worry about
needing to go buy them!

## Data logging - not done yet!

Could use either arduino or [raspberry
pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4292).

Not sure exactly the best way to log data.  Ideally I would log to github or
google drive.

Need to figure out how to get

attached to the raspberry pi if i use that.
