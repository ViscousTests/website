[Assembled grow system](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GEtHNZCn71pov2b39) and planted two net pots with kale/lettuce seeds.  The net pots had holes that didn't hold in the small vermiculite particles, so I lined them with a paper towel.  After planting, I watered them until water was running through without filling the container itself.  Hopefully they will stay moist enough this way to sprout.  Otherwise I'll fill the container.

Getting sprouts for Kale seeds as of yesterday!  No activity for lettuce seeds yet.  Put some in a ziploc bag with a paper towel to try getting activity that way.

First roots penetrating the bottom of the net pots today.  I filled the water tank ~4 gallons and added 4tsp of nutrients (MaxiGro 10-5-14) - TDS was 700 ppm.  Fiddled with pH to get final value of around 6; this required adding ~1tsp of baking soda.  Looking forward to fast growth - sprouts are still small (one leaf pair each).

Kale is growing really well!  I filled 3 more tanks last night, as the
broccoli, spinach, more kale, and basil have now sprouted.  I used the same
proportion of nutrients as the first tank, and didn't measure the pH this time.

First kale plant has become so big it is hitting the light and crowding other plants.  Probably need to make more space between the lights and the plants in the future.  Plants first batch of cabbage.

Three more bins have sprouted; I filled them with water today.
