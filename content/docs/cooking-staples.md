## Creme Brulee

Ingredients

    2 cups heavy or light cream, or half-and-half
    1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    ⅛ teaspoon salt
    5 egg yolks
    ½ cup sugar, more for topping

Preparation

    1. Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a saucepan, combine cream, vanilla bean and
       salt and cook over low heat just until hot. Let sit for a few minutes,
       then discard vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add it now.)
    2. In a bowl, beat yolks and sugar together until light. Stir about a
       quarter of the cream into this mixture, then pour sugar-egg mixture into
       cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce ramekins and place ramekins in a
       baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the
       dishes. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool
       completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days.
    3. When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a
       thin layer. Place ramekins in a broiler 2 to 3 inches from heat source.
       Turn on broiler. Cook until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a
       bit, about 5 minutes. Serve within two hours.

## Flank Steak with Red Wine Vinegar and Greens

Total:28 min
Prep:8 min
Cook:20 min

Yield:4 servings

Ingredients

2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 pounds flank steak, cut into 4 equal pieces
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves or 1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
10 ounces (1 bag) Italian salad blend

Directions

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season both sides of the
steaks with salt and pepper. Cook in 2 batches if necessary. When the oil is hot
and shimmering, add the steaks and cook, tuning each once, until seared and rich
mahogany, about 6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer the steaks to a
plate.

Add the garlic to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, until aromatic, about
1 minute. Pull the skillet from the heat, add the vinegar, and use a wooden
spoon to scrape up any brown bits that cling to the pan. Stir in the oregano,
butter, and any juices from the steak, until the butter melts. Add the greens to
the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and toss until they begin to wilt,
about 30 seconds.

Slice the meat against the grain into thin slices, divide between 4 plates, top
with the greens and the pan juices. Serve.
