# 01/16/2022 Week in review

Started on the biomarker correlator project with Michael Lustgarten, made good
progress. Clojure is still kinda frustrating to work with, so many functions to
learn! It seems like there is a lot of initial breath to master before getting
really in the flow.

Modded Skyrim and started a playthrough. It's fun to get distracted by all the
random things in the world :).

Took lunch home every day at work, which made me feel a lot more productive. My
"after-lunch-slump" was almost totally gone. Although I did tend to overeat at
night.  I think this is a solvable problem though.

Made progress on the Chamber analysis report, coming really close to totally
cleaning up the A/B user journey.  Mukul is leaving the team, mixed feelings.

Installed tenant dishwasher with new water detecting valve.  A bit concerned
that my daisy chain of adapters might fail in some obscure way, but my testing
didn't catch any issues.

Had a positive Chamber calibration server debugging session this week, where I
was able to identify why machine counts for a specific architecture were
dropping to zero. This involved incremental progress with various dremel
queries. It was very satisfying to never hit a wall during the process :).
