# Longevity Overview

Living as long as possible would be great!

## Resources

### [Lifespan by David Sinclair](https://lifespanbook.com/)

Cool review of a new theory of aging that seems promising to be.  Also does some
good review of longevity concepts.  This was my introduction to the field
(specifically a Joe Rogan Experience David Sinclair interview).

### Biohack Stack

Good place for ideas to experiment with.  Good example of an interesting profile:
