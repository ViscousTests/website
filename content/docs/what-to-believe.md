# What to Believe

In order to make good decisions, people need to build an understanding of how
the world works by gathering information.  Luckily, it is getting easier and
easier to do this as technology becomes more and more efficient at sending data
around the world.  Unfortunately, simply gathering information is not enough;
one must also make sure that the information is of high enough quality to use
in world modelling or decision making.

There are many reasons why information people share with each other may be
misleading or wrong.  One useful lens to look at this further is to think about
where the information the person who is sharing it is ultimately coming from:

## From Past Personal Experience

### What works 

Tinkerers (as described in the book
[Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)) are people who use
feedback from a specific task to improve and eventually become experts at doing
that task.  For instance a self-taught woodworker will eventually learn how to
create complex wooden structures based on past experience of how wood behaves
when he or she does things to it.  Or a chess player may learn that certain
patterns of pieces are dangerous or safe over time after winning or losing many
games.

Information derived from tinkerers is:

 - Often very practically useful
 - Rarely completely "wrong", just maybe only right in a very narrow scope.

But has these problems:

 - Deeper theories or reasons behind why the information is what it is are
   often absent or unrecoverable.  This limits the scope at which the
   information can be accurately applied.
 - Reproducing the logic behind the information can be very difficult or
   impossible, since it requires walking though the life experience of the
   tinkerer.  This can make it easy for the tinkerer to hide bias.

### From the Scientific Method

This is a great source of information, as it (should) explicitly state how
certain we are and in what context something is true.
