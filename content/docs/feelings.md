# Feelings

## Being in the Zone

Being in a state of mind where all your attention must be focused on a single thing to avoid failure, leading to an emptiness of other thoughts.


## Chaos to Solution

The feeling when you have no idea how to fix something but suddenly a solution appears out of nowhere. You may or may not understand how the solution works or where it came from.


## Constructive regret

The feeling when you step out of a test and think 'I knew that answer!!' in a way that makes you want to walk right back into the testing hall and fix your mistake.


## Discovery of hidden gems

Most of the time this activity is monotonous and/or forgettable, but occasionally it will yield an extremely memorable or life-changing experience.


## Easy to do

Requires little to no difficult decision making, so is therefore easy to pick up and do. This can lead to impulsively doing this thing too much.


## False Understanding

A state of mind where something seems to make sense emotionally, but if you were to try to explain it in your own words or otherwise apply the knowledge you would fail.


## Financial Control

A feeling that you understand and are in control of your finances.

  - positive

## Fitting puzzle pieces together

The feeling of finding the right place for a part of something you are building.


## Focus fragmenting

The feeling of constantly having your focus redirected, preventing you from going deeper on any one particular thing.


## Having a clear goal

The feeling of knowing exactly what you need to do.


## Joy of sharing

The feeling you get when you find something cool and share it with someone else.


## Pride of Construction

Feeling proud or even in awe of something you made that is now a (semi) permenant thing in the world. 

  - positive

## Reactive Randomness Stress

Committing a decision and then bracing yourself for bad things to happen based on some probability which you cannot stop (since you have already committed).


## Relaxing

Feeling comfortable and liable to zone out.

  - positive

## Scanning through possibilities

Constantly examining many options and determining the best one by some usually simple criteria.

  - engaging

## Skill clicking into place

The feeling when something that you thought was impossible, or otherwise had no idea how to even approach doing, you can suddenly do effortlessly.


## Thrill of Committment

Doing something with a penalty for failure that you can't turn back from.


## Triumph over Exposure

Putting yourself in a stressful situation and showing yourself that you can survive in it. I think this is a feeling Marc-Andr√© Leclerc was chasing in the movie 'The Alpinist'.


## Wonder

A sense of wonder at the beauty of the world.
