# Sprints, and Taking Breaks

Working on mentally hard tasks depletes mental energy reserves in a localized
way, similarly to how physically hard tasks deplete muscle energy reserves
[CITATION NEEDED beyond own experience].  Therefore, feeling stressed or guilty
about not being able to continue focusing on a task is counterproductive - use
of willpower to keep focused is a patch solution that many times actually
depletes even more mental energy.  A better solution is to move to another
location and take a break by zoning out or otherwise doing nothing.  Switching
tasks I find sometimes also can help with this - perhaps different types of
tasks exercise different mental energy reserves.  

The Pomodoro method uses the idea of "sprints" or "bursts" of mental effort,
followed by short breaks, usually in a 25m on, 5m off cadence.  In my
experience, it's not worth interrupting a flow state with 25m timers - using
this as a guideline generally works better for me.


# Food

Personally, eating - especially being full - can derail my ability to be in a
productive, flow state.  Given this, I try to adhere to this eating schedule to
minimize the time I spend full when I want to be productive:

 - Meal 1: After waking up and completing one work "sprint".
 - Meal 2: After finishing work and completing one personal "sprint".

For both cases, I should delay the meal as long as I don't feel hungry, and
even delay a bit if I do feel hungry, to take advantage of the productivity
boost that comes when anticipating food.
