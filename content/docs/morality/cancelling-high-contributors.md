# Cancelling Highly Productive People

Unfortunately, it seems like some highly productive people that have
permanently improved the lives of millions of people are also either not very
socially aware and/or are downright abusive to their colleagues. Often this
leads to allegations of harassment (sexual or otherwise), and a removal of the
person from their position.

It would be cool if we could somehow keep these people doing what they do
without giving them the power over others that they seem primed to abuse. I'm
not really satisfied with the current "derail their lives" approach to the
problem, as it seems like that leads to a net negative impact on society as a
whole.

Some people that I was thinking of as I wrote this (note that **I don't know if
these people are actually in the wrong or not, just that others think they
are**):
