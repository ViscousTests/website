# Right to Risk

Reading https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity made me think
about how much **personally** dangerous/risky behavior we should legally allow.
Should we allow unhealthy eating? Motorcycle riding? Messing with your own gut
microbiome? Messing with your own genes? Climbing? Self-harm? Suicide?

**Insurance**: More dangerous behaviors cost money. Who pays?

**Responsibility and Legality**: If you have a child, or are personally
responsible for someone, then hurting yourself pretty directly hurts that
person. Therefore, it makes sense to have stricter rules about risk taking when
someone is responsible for another. Hurting other people is legally forbidden,
after all.
