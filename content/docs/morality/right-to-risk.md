# Right to Risk

Reading https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity made me think
about how much **personally** dangerous/risky behavior we should legally allow.
Should we allow unhealthy eating? Motorcycle riding? Messing with your own gut
microbiome? Messing with your own genes? Climbing? Self-harm? Attempted
suicide?

## Insurance

More dangerous behaviors cost money. Who pays?

## Responsibility and Legality

If you have a child, or are personally responsible for someone, then hurting
yourself pretty directly hurts that person. Therefore, it makes sense to have
stricter rules about risk taking when someone is responsible for another.
Hurting other people is legally forbidden, after all. How much does this apply
to caregiver to caretaker relationships (e.g. child -> parent)? Romantic relationships? Friendships?

How much responsibility should we assume members of the same society should
have for each other?
