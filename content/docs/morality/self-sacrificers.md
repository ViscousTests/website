# Self Sacrificers

There are those who corrupt their own moral standing to benefit society:

* Soldiers become killers to protect (a) society
* Entrepreneurs become overconfident liars to effectively test their ideas, as they cannot know with confidence that their ideas will survive contact with the world, but they must convince some people that they will for investment.  Politicians do the same.

I feel like we should have a term for this phenomenon.
