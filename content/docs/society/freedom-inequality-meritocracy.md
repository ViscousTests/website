# Freedom, Inequality, and Meritocracy

I was listening to the rational reminder financial podcast and they had [an
episode about financial
literacy](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yYXRpb25hbHJlbWluZGVyLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/ZjQyYThmNjktZjhiMC00MzFmLTk0NzQtM2EwZTY2ODc0ZTk5?ep=14)
and one of the statistics they mentioned was 30 to 40% of retirement savings can
be explained by financial literacy alone.
If true, it’s kind of crazy to think that a large fraction of the financial
inequality in at least the United States or wherever the study was done is due
to financial literacy.

This got me thinking more generally about the price of freedom to make our own
choices and to play the game of life.
I feel like in a very individualistic society like the United States people have
a lot of freedom with their choices and there's relatively little guidance or
forced defaulting that helps guide people to make the right decisions.
For instance, I can do whatever I want with my own money: I can invest it in
whatever I want, or just put it all in the bank without investing it anywhere.
I can buy the most random stuff with it and there's no real fall back if I make
poor decisions - I just have to suffer the consequences.
This is true with a lot of other things too like physical health, media
consumption habits, mental health, etc.
A lot of these areas are very unintuitive and difficult to perform well in so
it's very easy to “lose” the game of life in certain dimensions without the
defaulting or other guardrails that are less "free" society would provide to its
citizens.
I think this freedom to make decisions and stuff has a lot of benefits but
without any defaults I feel like you can lead a lot of people to make really
poor decisions just because they don't know any better and that can perpetuate a
lot of problems like social inequality.

This line of thinking has made me think that "information inequality" via lack
of exposure to people who talk about finances or talk about health or whatever
might be a bigger problem than I thought.
If someone doesn't expose themselves to said people or their culture doesn't
really value this kind of knowledge, or has suboptimal opinions on how to
approach these topics, they are going to have a harder time succeeding in life.
They will be making worse decisions due to their information environment.

I think having the government provide some basic default services that people
have to opt out of might help combat this inequality.
The price of these services would be deducted from paychecks, but if people
wanted to solve these problems themselves they could just opt out and get their
money directly.
There's probably a lot of problems with this idea that I haven't thought of.
