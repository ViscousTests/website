# Gerrymandering

In the US, a mostly agreed upon problem is that our legislative districts are
drawn in a biased way which favors whichever party was in power when the lines
were last drawn.
This is easy because geographical boundaries are pretty arbitrary, and IMO do a
bad job of sorting people into representable groups.
So there isn't really a way to judge the quality of the lines as they are drawn.

Taking a step back, the goal of a representative democratic system is for
representatives to _represent_ the needs of their constituents.
This is easier if the constituents are more similar in their views, as then the
representative needs to do less work to consider all the different perspectives
they should be representing.
It strikes me that where someone lives is not a great determinant of their
political views, or at least there are better determinants (see some discussion
of this in [The Black Swan - "The Narrative Fallacy" - "to be wrong with
infinite precision"]({{< relref "/docs/books/The-Black-Swan.md" >}})).
Some examples:

 - Profession (the best one I can think of)
 - Income
 - Net worth
 - Gender
 - Race

It's interesting to think about what would happen if our "district lines" were
drawn among these dimensions instead of geography.

Right away I see a couple problems:

 - People may try to make the insincere case that they belong to a specific
   group for political reasons.
 - The problematic "in-group/out-group" psychology humans struggle with would be
   triggered more directly (e.g. "How dare these LGBTQ people call themselves
   <insert gender here> and claim to be part of my group?!").

It does seem like this kind of system might be more "honest" or at least
straightforward - it seems like geographical lines are often used as a proxy for
these characteristics anyway.

Or we could just get rid of the concept of representation of specific groups of
people and just give parties representatives according to a single popular vote
for the party.
