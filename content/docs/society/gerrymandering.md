# Gerrymandering

In the US, a mostly agreed upon problem is that our legislative districts are
drawn in a biased way which favors whichever party was in power when the lines
were last drawn.
This is easy because geographical boundaries are pretty arbitrary, and IMO do a
bad job of sorting people into representable groups.
So there isn't really a way to judge the quality of the lines as they are drawn.

## Representative Groups

Taking a step back, the goal of a representative democratic system is for
representatives to _represent_ the needs of their constituents.
This is easier if the constituents are more similar in their views, as then the
representative needs to do less work to consider all the different perspectives
they should be representing.
It strikes me that where someone lives is not a great determinant of their
political views, or at least there are better determinants (see some discussion
of this in [The Black Swan - "The Narrative Fallacy" - "to be wrong with
infinite precision"]({{< relref "/docs/books/The-Black-Swan.md" >}})).
Some examples (sorted roughly by practicality as perceived by me):

 - Age
 - Profession
 - Income
 - Net worth
 - Gender
 - Race

**It's interesting to think about what would happen if our "district lines" were
drawn among these dimensions instead of geography.**

For example, if we shifted to a profession-based system, then all engineers
would have a representative, as would all doctors, professors, janitors,
warehouse workers, etc.
Previously, these same people would have been represented by their location in a
city/state/country - the northern district would have a representative, as well
as the southern, eastern, and western districts.

Personally it feels like I would be better represented in this system, or at
least my representation is easier to conceptualize/understand.

Right away I see a couple problems:

 - People may try to make the insincere case that they belong to a specific
   group for political reasons.
 - The problematic "in-group/out-group" psychology humans struggle with would be
   triggered more directly (e.g. "How dare these LGBTQ people call themselves
   [insert gender here] and claim to be part of my group?!").

It does seem like this kind of system might at least be more "honest" or at least
straightforward - it seems like geographical lines are often used as a proxy for
these characteristics anyway.

## Issue-Based Representation

One interesting point is that different groups may be more or less relevant for
different issues.
For instance, geography is very relevant when deciding where to add new bus
lines.
And profession is very relevant when deciding how to tax different industries.

If our goal is to make the job of representatives easier by giving them a
homogeneous group of constituents, this is an issue.

There are at least two ways to handle this:

1. Have different representative groups for different issues.
   This gets complicated - do we have multiple presidents??
1. Try to pick groups that lead to the most relevance across the most issues.
   At least we can do better than geography, right?

## Abandoning Representativeness

We could instead just get rid of the concept of representation of specific
groups of people and just give parties representatives according to a single
popular vote for the party.
**Party identity is in a sense the best way to group people by their political
views**.
For instance, if there were 100 seats and 45% of people nationwide voted for
democrats, then democrats would get 45 seats regardless of the locations of
their voters.
It looks like Germany does this in part by giving parties extra seats in their
legislature based on their total national vote share after all constituencies
have been given seats:
