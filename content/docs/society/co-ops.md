# Co-ops

## Marxism

I just finished listening to The Lex Friedman podcast with Richard Wolff on
Marxism.
As I understood it he describes Marxism as not really an active proposal for how
to structure society, but rather as just a critique of capitalism and a specific
description of what about capitalism is wrong without any necessarily specific
instructions about what to do instead.
For instance he talks about how Marx almost never talked about government.
It didn't sound like he had many opinions about whether government should be big
or small or whatever.

## Co-ops

This lack of actionability led me to be really grasping during the podcast to
try to figure out what could be tried that would be better than capitalism.
One thing that caught my attention was Richard Wolff's description of co-ops as
something that Marx would probably approve of.

A co-op is just a business where all the revenue that comes in is distributed by
the employees.
The people who are employees of the co-op or maybe even co-owners decide what to
do with that profit and it's not up to one single individual like an owner to
distribute the money as they see fit.
It seems like by this definition a co-op like structure could help reduce the
inequality that we see in the world because it doesn't seem like a collection of
employees would vote to pay one person like say the owner a lot more than
everybody else.

So I started thinking about what this means - how would you actually achieve a
co-op like structure where I'll just say everybody is a co-owner.
There's probably other ways to do it but that makes the most sense or is the
simplest to me.
So everybody owns an equal share of the business and they have equal voting
rights.

I struggle to understand how this could happen.
For example, let's say I start a software business, write some software, and
then sell it directly to people who pay me for the program and support.
Let's say that I run the business by myself and one day want to hire somebody
else to help me with the business.
It seems like what I would have to do is upon hiring of that person I would have
to give them a gift of half the company.
Or maybe as they work they would grow their half of the company because if I
just gave him half the company then in theory they could just sell it and leave
and never actually work for me and just take the money.
So maybe they would have to over time work up to it like a vesting schedule.

Even then it's it seems kind of strange that the person that you hire has so
much leverage immediately on the company.
Maybe that's not that strange but it feels strange to me especially if you're
hiring somebody to do a specific task.
For instance if you needed to pay somebody to just make the graphics for your
website and that's it.
For someone hired to do some very specific task that doesn't necessarily involve
strategic direction over the company it seems weird that they would be given a
big part of something that you built.
This would mean people would just have to be very careful about how they hire,
which would probably slow a company's ability to hire because you're not really
hiring somebody you're more like partnering with somebody.
Every single person who joins your organization effectively becomes a partner.

This would make decision making a lot harder because pretty much everything
would have to be voted on.
Perhaps there would be representatives like like an internal senate or something
where representatives would make the decisions for the company's direction and
not every single employee would have to be involved.

The part of this like that's the most unclear to me is like how you could set up
a structure where when you're hiring your first, your second, or third, fourth,
fifth employee how their ownership would manifest.
What would happen if they leave?
Are they forced to sell their shares in the company when they leave or does it
just disappear and everybody else gets a bigger slice of the company?
Or their voting rights are lost but they still hold their shares?

Maybe thinking about the company in terms of shares is part of my confusion.
Maybe it shouldn't be thought of that way, although in the end if a majority of
the employees decide to sell the company that should be possible.
Then there would be a way for employees to cash out.
Perhaps limiting the liquidity of the stock is the way to manage these issues.

This train of thought makes me interested in learning more how current co-ops
like Costco or WinCo or PCC grew.
How did they start?
How do they grow?
Does every employee have an equal voting right who owns them?
