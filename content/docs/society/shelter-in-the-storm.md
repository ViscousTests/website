# Shelter In The Storm

Sometimes it feels accurate to describe the world as a raging storm that drains
your wealth as your stand in it.
The only way to survive is to find pockets of shelter that shield you from this
drain and build you up for any future forays into the storm.
These pockest are most commonly jobs, but could also be self constructed passive
income systems.
