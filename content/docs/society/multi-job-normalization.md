# Normalizing Multiple Jobs

It would be interesting if it was the norm for most people to work multiple
(e.g. 2) part time jobs, instead of one full time job.

Benefits:

 - You are more diversified.
   If one of your employers has to lay you off you are in a less severe
   situation.
 - Your work might be less monotonous.

Issues:

 - In a "knowledge worker"-type role, one job might interest you more than the
   other for a time period, leading to an uneven distribution of mental effort.
 - Benefits (e.g. healthcare) would be more complicated to manage.
   IMO benefits shouldn't be tied to employment as much as they are in the U.S.
   now, but this would currently be a problem.
