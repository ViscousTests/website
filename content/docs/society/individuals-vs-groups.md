# Individuals Vs Groups

Political problems are complicated and multifaceted almost by definition.
Therefore, there are usually many different perspectives from which they can
be viewed. Two of these are:

 - Looking at the effects the problem (and its solutions) have on
   **individuals.**
 - Looking at the effects the problem (and its solutions) have on **groups of
   people.**

Both perspectives are important; it's easy to take a solely individual
perspective and, in doing so, blind oneself to some of the best solution for
the world's biggest problems (e.g. climate change, wealth inequality).
