# Livelihood Traps

## The Problem

Many people are not able to live in accordance with their values because their
work constrains their behavior.
When their values come into conflict with those of their employer, often people
cede to the employer's values because they don't want to lose their job.
In America, losing your job means losing your health insurance and potentially
having a hard time finding another job.

This dynamic leads to persistence of inefficient and often harmful status quos.
For instance, there are many jobs that are "bullshit" in that they don't
contribute meaningfully to society, or even detract from it.
People with these jobs are often aware of this, but they don't want to lose
their job, so they continue to do it and even defend its existence!

Politicians often pander to large electorates of people with jobs on the sole
platform of maintaining them or making more, nevermind the usefulness of the
jobs in question.  This makes me sad.

For some, their job also becomes a part of their identity, and then they start
defending their job for more personal reasons like these:

## Solutions

- Government-provided health insurance or even income
- Easier ways for people to self organize to retrain for new jobs.
  This could be accomplished via making interviews at companies based more on
  skill demonstration and less on credentials.
