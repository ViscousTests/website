# Social Games

I used to play Team Fortress 2 on a specific server (OSU) with a list of
regular players.  Over time I started recognizing these players, which led to a
natural community forming. This community led to some of my most memorable
gaming experiences, which I haven't been able to replicate with today's
convenient but faceless matchmaking systems.

This NeverKnowsBest video does an excellent job describing this phenomenon in
the context of MMORPGs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOqTjL4x7FA
