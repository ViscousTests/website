# Social Games

I used to play Team Fortress 2 on a specific server (OSU) with a list of
regular players.  Over time I started recognizing these players, which led to a
natural community forming. This community led to some of my most memorable
gaming experiences, which I haven't been able to replicate with today's
convenient but faceless matchmaking systems.

This NeverKnowsBest video does an excellent job describing this phenomenon in
the context of MMORPGs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOqTjL4x7FA

It would be cool if more games were structured to "pool" players in such a way
that through normal game play you would see the same people over and over. This
would lead to you getting to know their playstyle, and would make it easier to
start conversations. In other words, this would make the experience similar to
something like playing pick up basketball at a community center.
