# My Projects

Here's a list of mainly unfinished projects I've worked on in the past. Like
the rest of this site, this is mostly for me to remember stuff I've done more
easily, in case I want to resume work or apply parts of these projects to other
things.


## Market Trading Board Game

My take on a resource management euro-style game. Code and links to a Tabletop
Simulator mod that lets you play the game can be found at
https://github.com/kovasap/market_trading_game. The game is playable, but not
super balanced.


## My Take on Auto-Chess

Code can be found at https://github.com/kovasap/rtbb. Requires Godot engine to
play currently (I haven't made release builds). The current version is probably
broken - I left off at adding a side-scrolling background for moving to the
next fight, but haven't finished it yet.

Mostly inspired by the development of SNKRX at https://github.com/a327ex/SNKRX.


## Farming Turn Based Tactics Game

Code can be found at https://github.com/kovasap/farming_strategy_game. Inspired
by resource management board games, and turn based tactics games. Supposed to
be a fusion of these genres.
