# Limiting Collaboration

In several turn-based collaborative multiplayer games I've played
(_Gloomhaven_, _Pandemic_, _Divinity Original Sin 2_), I've noticed a common
issue that draws out what would otherwise be a more streamlined experience.
This is that, while these games usually have players control specific
characters, in reality what happens is that the playgroup as a whole decides on
the best move that everyone should take. Then everyone just makes the agreed
upon move. This effectively turns a "multiplayer" game into a complex "single
player" experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to
consensus. Another way to say this is that the game starts getting **"played by
committee"**.

This is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:

 - Often a few people end up leading the group, and effectively playing the
   game for everyone else.
 - If leaders don't emerge, it takes a lot of time to get everyone on the same
   page about a specific plan of action, which can make the game tedious.

## A Solution: Secret Objectives

[Dead of Winter]({{< relref "/docs/experiences/Dead-of-Winter.md" >}}) gets
around this problem partially by giving players secret objectives that may be
directly in conflict. This and some other mechanics make the game play more
like a "normal" competitive game.

## A Solution: Communication Limiting

An elegant solution to the above problem (which I haven't tried yet), is to put
constraints on the communication that can be done between players during the
game.  Some ways of doing this include:

 - Only letting players controlling characters that are physically close
   together on the board to speak to each other. This is very easily done with
   chat apps (Discord, SMS, etc.).
 - Putting a time limit (or character limit) on communication. If the limit is
   exceeded, then the players will lose turns - their characters were spending
   time talking instead of acting.

These options are interesting because they produce a trade off - is it better
for our actions to be more in sync, or should we just act with less
synchronization?

Game mechanics could also play into this communication limitation - for
instance, characters that can communicate telepathically with others may be
immune to any limits.


## Comments from coworker to integrate

I guess you might break it up into a few more parts
* Permission (can I talk to this person at all)
* Duration (how much time can I communicate with this person)
* Dictionary-space (how much vocabulary do I have to communicate)

Physical closeness 'permission' and time-limit per-action/turn you cover,
however there are two things I might add that limit effectiveness of
communication:
* Role-playing
* Language limits

With roleplaying, while it may be optimal to take a course of action, it may
not be what the character would do (for example, against a demon and a lich it
may be optimal to disrupt the lich's spellcasting, but your character may have
hatred of demons).  This is most applicable in TTRPGs like D&D and Pathfinder
and less applicable in Video Games or some Board Games.   This doesn't limit
theoretical communication, but may limits it's impact depending on your group.

Language limits the dictionary of what can be said, but doesn't necessarily
limit how much can be said within that dictionary.  For example, Gloomhaven
before your two cards are selected limits communication to 'relative' values
(ex. I am going as fast as possible and will do an AoE) rather than absolutes
(ex. I am moving with Mana Bolt at 07 initiative and will top with coldfire).
This still lets people communicate freely, but can limit knowledge.  This also
encourages players building knowledge of each others abilities and what they do
in combat, somewhat like a small group of mercenaries would.
