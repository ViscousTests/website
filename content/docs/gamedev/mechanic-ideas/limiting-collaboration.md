# Limiting Collaboration

In several turn-based collaborative multiplayer games I've played
(_Gloomhaven_, _Pandemic_, _Divinity Original Sin 2_), I've noticed a common
issue that draws out what would otherwise be a more streamlined experience.
This is that, while these games usually have players control specific
characters, in reality what happens is that the playgroup as a whole decides on
the best move that everyone should take. Then everyone just makes the agreed
upon move. This effectively turns a "multiplayer" game into a complex "single
player" experience, where the single player is a group trying to come to
consensus.

This is not in-itself a problem, but it does lead to some issues:

 - Often a few people end up leading the group, and effectively playing the
   game for everyone else.
 - If leaders don't emerge, it takes a lot of time to get everyone on the same
   page about a specific plan of action, which can make the game tedious.

## Solution: Communication Limiting

An elegant solution to the above problem (which I haven't tried yet), is to put
constraints on the communication that can be done between players during the
game.  Some ways of doing this include:

 - Only letting players controlling characters that are physically close
   together on the board to speak to each other. This is very easily done with
   chat apps (Discord, SMS, etc.).
 - Putting a time limit (or character limit) on communication. If the limit is
   exceeded, then the players will lose turns - their characters were spending
   time talking instead of acting.

These options are interesting because they produce a trade off - is it better
for our actions to be more in sync, or should we just act with less
synchronization?

Game mechanics could also play into this communication limitation - for
instance, characters that can communicate telepathically with others may be
immune to any limits.
