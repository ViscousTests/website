# Minimizing UI Friction in Turn Based Tactics Games

Games like XCOM, Fire Emblem, Warhammer 40k Mechanicus, Gloomhaven Digital etc.
sometimes have a problem with requiring many clicks/actions from the player to
execute actions.  To minimize this, you could have the player's options for
what a character should do on a tile appear as a button on that tile. For
multiple actions these buttons could be arranged in a grid.

For example, a character could move to an empty tile (just one option with one
button).  Or if they could cast an aoe ability on that tile then on hover that
tile would have two buttons.  Clicking one would automatically take that
action.

When hovering an enemy, buttons would appear for each type of attack the
character could do.  For out of range enemies, a shadow movement could appear
when hovering to make the attack possible with just one click!
