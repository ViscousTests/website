# Random Technologies

For a management or economic game, make new technologies randomly get discovered at a rate proportional to the player's "research power" (the resources they put towards research).
One cool way to make this work is to have a hidden dependency web (e.g.
fire must be discovered before cooking), and then randomly select a tech to be discovered from the set of all techs that have had all their dependencies discovered.
This would force the player to adapt to the consequences of what their people discover, and make the game more dynamic and replayable.
