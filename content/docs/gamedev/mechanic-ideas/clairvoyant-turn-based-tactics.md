# Clairvoyant Turn Based Tactics

Instead of guessing or assuming what the computer opponent will do in a turn
based tactics game like fire emblem or xcom, have the current move of the
opponent always displayed on screen.  To be more precise, show the exact
movement and actions of all enemy units that would take place if the player
ended their turn right now.  As the player plans out their moves, update the
enemy moves that would happen if the player committed to their current plan.
This should lead to a very tight feedback look as the player gets constant
updates as the move their movement selection from tile to tile.

This should help with unpleasant surprises that require reloads in these games.
See Into the Breach for a cool variant of this concept (where all enemy moves
are statically predetermined and do not change at all).
