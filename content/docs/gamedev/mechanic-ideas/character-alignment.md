# Character Alignment Visualization

If a character in an RPG becomes more intelligent, strong, or aligned with a
particular element, their color (or background color) could be hue-shifted to
reflect this. This would make it easier to at-a-glance determine more about
different characters in the game. This would additionally provided some "woah"
factor if you come across a character with a particularly strong (saturated)
color aura.
