# Real Time Strategy

One big issue I have with real time economic simulation games ([Offworld Trading
Company]({{< relref "/docs/games/Offworld-Trading-Company.md" >}}),
[Rimworld]({{< relref "/docs/games/Rimworld.md" >}}), [Oxygen Not Included]({{<
relref "/docs/games/oxygen-not-included.md" >}})) is that there is often a
period of the game where you are just waiting for resources to accumulate or for
some random event to happen.
This IMO is a really bad experience because (1) it's boring and (2) it puts the
player in a more reactive frame of mind.
Turn based games sidestep this problem.
