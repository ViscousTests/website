# Game Types/Mechanics/Appeals

## Engine Building

When a player continually updates a state (e.g. a farm or rpg character or
desk) with new elements, with each step making the state better at achieving
some goal.  Often, the state will become even better with each update that the
last update made it; the rate of state betterment per step is convex.  In the
end, the state may be able to "go infinite" or otherwise reach some victory
game state in one turn.

### Examples

 - The game board is an engine in Magic: TG.
 - The player boards + cards in Agricola.
 - The player boards in Wingspan.
 

## Knowledge Building

Playing through the games gives insight that allows progression.

### Examples
 - Outer Wilds
 - Roguelikes


## Urgency

Some sense that the player needs to do something to avoid loss is important to
avoid players getting bored. If nothing happens when they do nothing, how much
do the player's actions really mean?
