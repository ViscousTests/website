# Safe Building Designer

Game goes in two phases: the build phase and the run phase. 

During the build phase, you try to design a building that is safe to occupy.
This includes adding fire sprinklers, putting trash cans in the right places,
having proper heating and cooling.

During the run phase, people come to live/work in the building you designed,
and get up to all sorts of crazy shenanigans. The goal is that any fires they
start or other mischeif they cause is mitigated properly by your design.
