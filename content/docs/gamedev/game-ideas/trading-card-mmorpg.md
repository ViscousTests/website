# Trading Card MMORPG

In my experience one of the biggest strengths of an MMORPG is the player driven
economy and the interactions with other players that the economy forces.  Often
 I think the gameplay of an MMORPG - what you actually do most of the time - is one of its weaker points.
  For example quests like kill x monsters or collect x objects can be very tedious.

Trading card games are generally pretty fun to play
And real world trading card games already have an economy built in - trading the cards.
So it seems like a natural pairing to me to have an MMO where most of the gameplay is playing a game of cards against AI or against other players to earn cards which then you can trade with other players in a player driven economy.
