## VOLA @ Neptune - Sept 2025

First show at the neptune!

Openers (foxcult) had really bad audio balance; all I could hear was the drums and the vocalist.
Vocalist had some real energy though.  Would have been cool with a darker light show.

Daedric was OK, guitars/drums a little too noisy IMO.  Not as crisp as the recorded music.

VOLA was really incredible.  Great lights and energy.  I wish I knew their lyrics better!
Daedric singer joined in on "Cannibal", which was amazing!
