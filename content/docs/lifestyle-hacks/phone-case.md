# 3-in-1 Phone Case

This system for a wallet, keys, and phone in one package has been serving me
pretty well.  It doesn't add much noticeable bulk to my phone at all, and even
makes it a bit easier to hold because my fingers can grab the pouch instead of
the other side of the phone.

I used a cheap, thin rubber phone case with the [Sinjimoru Card
Holder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HY3HSZQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
for this system.
