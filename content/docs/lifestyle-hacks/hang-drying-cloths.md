# Hang (Air) Drying Cloths

I've found that hang drying cloths over using a cloths dryer has some pretty
neat advantages:

### Less Work

IF you hang dry your cloths in a place where they can stay indefinitely, then
hang drying leads to this laundry workflow:

1. Wash cloths
1. Hang dry - this must happen now because cloths are wet!
1. Easily find what you want to wear (since everything is hanging up) and wear
   it.

I find this easier than my previous workflow, which was:

1. Wash cloths
1. Transfer to dryer
1. Put in laundry bin to fold later
1. Never actually fold later and dig through the bin to find stuff when I need
   to wear it.  This is especially annoying with socks.  And it leads to
   wrinkly cloths.

Even if I did fold the cloths, I find that hanging cloths up is easier
physically easier than folding them and putting them away.

### Longer Lasting Cloths

Cloths seem to wear out less quickly for me using this technique.
Unfortunately I have no evidence of this and am a biased source, so this may
not actually be true.  I'd be surprised if cloths wore out more quickly though
: ).

### Cheaper

If we assume the average cloths dryer using 3000W and drys cloths in 2 hrs,
then to do one load of laundry takes 6kWh.  In Seattle, this would cost
`$0.11/kWh * 6kWh = $0.66` per load of laundry.  So not much, but something!


## My Current System

I hang my cloths above my 4-poster bed, which I find is a pretty efficient use
of space:

One thing to be careful of is the weight of the cloths on the structure you're
using, which can be significant!
