# Reddit Comment Tree

I was curious about which Reddit comments end up getting many upvotes, so I
made this visualization:

<figure>
  <a href="/reddit-tree.html">
    <img src="/docs/datavis/reddit-tree.png" alt="reddit tree"/>
  </a>
  <figcaption><small>Click the image to go to the interactive page!</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<!--
<iframe src="/reddit-tree.html" width="100%" height="100%" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
-->

The code can be found at
[github.com/kovasap/reddit-tree](https://github.com/kovasap/reddit-tree).
