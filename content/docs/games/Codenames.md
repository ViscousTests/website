One variant worth trying is trying to play with pictures instead of words on the main board. A stand-alone game (Codenames Pictures) exists for this, but it's also fun to try using custom pictures. For instance, the dream cards from Mysterium led to a pretty fun game. Note that [this site](https://codenames-pictures.dport.me/) looks like it allows you to do this in a virtual setting.
