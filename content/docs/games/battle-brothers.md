{{< game-img "battle-brothers" "400px" >}}

Good tactical RPG set in a low fantasy world.
Lots of character customization via different weapon types, and stat/perk
assignment on level up.
Not to mention the starting stats given to each character.

Unfortunately, the randomness in this game will lead to characters dying, so if
you want to preserve specific characters get ready to save and load a lot :).
This game is pretty hard and doesn't necessarily give you direct feedback as to
why you are failing.
The combat uses randomness pretty heavily to determine hit/miss/crit (head hit)
chance, which means that the consequences of your actions are 'fuzzed' - good
decisions will sometimes be punished, and bad ones you will sometimes get away
with.
This means that it's tricky to personally track if your strategy is working
without a decent time investment for each strategy you are trying.
