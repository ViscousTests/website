# Bananagrams

One fun variant is to open a book in text format with some program that can search text and make it so that you can only use words that exist in that book.

For a game with more players, this variation might be interesting to try: http://nongraphical.com/2013/09/a-more-awesome-way-to-play-bananagrams/.

To make hard varients easier, you can play with a "wildcard rule".  With this rule, you are allowed to flip over one of your tiles and treat it as a wildcard letter.  You can choose to switch out which tile is flipped at any time.
