# Chess

I play my chess on [lichess.org](https://www.lichess.org), which has a great UI and cool analysis features.

I've learned a lot from watching GothamChess on YouTube, especially his opening videos.

I want to try out [chessable](https://www.chessable.com/?page=landingpage) at some point.

https://www.alexcrompton.com/blog/time-thoughts-chess has good guidance for dealing with timed games.

https://www.openingtree.com/ is a good analysis tool to identify weaknesses across all your games.
