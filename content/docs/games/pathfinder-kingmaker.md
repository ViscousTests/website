### Information Obfuscation

The mental load of trying to make decisions in this game, like which enemy to
target with which skill, is really high.  I think this is because:

 - Chance to hit is not calculated for you
 - ...

This makes me think that the game is not actually meant to be played as a
tactical strategy game, but rather as a level-gated exploration game (where you
just run from too-high-level fights instead of trying to puzzle them out).
