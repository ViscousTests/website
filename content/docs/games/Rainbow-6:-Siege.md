# Rainbow 6: Siege

## Summary

Very intense and engaging game that requires a high level of focus.
Every movement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement
gives away your position and makes you vulnerable.
However, like in most shooters,if you proactively move to shoot at a particular
point, you will still have an advantage against someone reacting to your
movement.

This leads to a dynamic where both you and your opponent are trying to determine
the location of the other without giving away their own location - once one
person knows withc ertainty they can simply move to attack and will have a strong
advantage.This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes,
which have attacking and defending sides.
Attackers must move to engage the defenders, meaning that they start out
disadvantaged (they are moving and making noise while defenders are not).
To counter this, attackers all have remote control drones that make noise when
they move around.
These are easily destroyed, but can be used to determine the locations of
defenders, giving attackers advantage.

## Tips

### Angles to Hold

 - Long angles, longer the better
 - Angles with wierd elevation

### Angles NOT to Hold

 - Short angles
     - Instead, play next to the angle and peek when you hear movement on the other side.  Works best with a shotgun
