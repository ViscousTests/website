# Rainbow 6: Siege

Very intense and engaging game that requires a high level of focus. Everymovement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement givesaway your position and makes you vulnerable. However, like in most shooters,if you proactively move to shoot at a particular point, you will still have anadvantage against someone reacting to your movement. This leads to a dynamicwhere both you and your opponent are trying to determine the location of theother without giving away their own location - once one person knows withcertainty they can simply move to attack and will have a strong advantage.This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes, which haveattacking and defending sides. Attackers must move to engage the defenders,meaning that they start out disadvantaged (they are moving and making noisewhile defenders are not). To counter this, attackers all have remote controldrones that make noise when they move around. These are easily destroyed, butcan be used to determine the locations of defenders, giving attackersadvantage.
