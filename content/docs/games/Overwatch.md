## Strategy

### "Bowl" Concept

Many Overwatch maps have bowl shaped sections where there is an objective
surrounded by high ground or buildings.
Fighting in the center of the bowl is often very dangerous because you can be
attacked from multiple directions at once.
Because of this, it might be a good rule of thumb to fight on the edges of the
bowl either against others on the edge or, ideally, against enemies in the
center of the bowl.
Likewise, it might be good to be aware of when you are in the bowl and make sure
you can easily get out!
