## Strategy

### "Bowl" Concept

Many Overwatch maps have bowl shaped sections where there is an objective
surrounded by high ground or buildings.
Fighting in the center of the bowl is often very dangerous because you can be
attacked from multiple directions at once.
Because of this, it might be a good rule of thumb to fight on the edges of the
bowl either against others on the edge or, ideally, against enemies in the
center of the bowl.
Likewise, it might be good to be aware of when you are in the bowl and make sure
you can easily get out!

### Scorpion Formation

The tank is the head, the DPS are the two pincers, and the supports are the body and tail.

 - One DPS is always on the left of the tank, one is always on the right
     - This should help put maximum pressure on the enemy formation; it's harder
       to defend against two directions of attack than one!
 - One support focuses primarily on healing the tank at all times, the other flexes

### Communication

Led by a support, since they have the best view of the battle.
The communication leader should call when the team is changing "states":

 - **Regroup**: Don't fight the enemy, fall back (into spawn if necessary) and
   wait for teammates to respawn.
     - This should happen when the team has a numbers disadvantage.
 - **Poke**: Tentatively push up and try to get into power positions or the right formation.
 - **Go HAM / Fire at Will**: Just attack whoever is easiest or you have the best advantage against.
     - This should happen when the team has a numbers advantage.
