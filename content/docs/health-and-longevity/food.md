# Food

## Goals

1. Delay chronic diseases as long as possible.  Described well in [this talk by
   Peter Attia](https://vimeo.com/228845024).  The
   [big ones](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm) are:
   1. Cardiovascular disease.
   1. Cancer.
   1. Neurodegenerative disease.
   1. Diabetes/Metabolic Syndrome.
1. Maintain sustained energy levels as much as possible, avoiding:
   1. Periods of low motivation.
   1. "Food coma-ing".
   1. "Snack train-ing", or continuous distraction by a desire to eat more.

## Current Eating Habits and Opinions (3/2022)

NOTE that these habits are obselete, up to date ones can be found at [Daily
Habits]({{< relref "/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/daily-habits.md" >}})!

### Food Timing

I try to eat a breakfast after I wake up - around 9am, since I wake up around
8:30am.  Then I tend not to eat lunch, and instead eat my second (and last)
meal of the day at around 5 or 6pm.

I converged on this strategy via the observation that eating food when I am not
hungry (too quickly after my last meal) really kills my energy levels. With
this strategy, I can eat two large meals and avoid this problem, maximizing the
amount of time I can stay capable of doing whatever I want during the day.

With this strategy (and any food timing strategy IMO) it's important for me to
suppress suggestions from my mind to combat momentary ebbs in energy with a
snack. This pretty much never works for me, always making me more tired then
before I ate the snack. Green tea is a good placeholder to have instead. Or
even better, an engaging activity that captures my attention.

This strategy also has the danger of going on a snack train when having my
second meal. If I eat too much in the evening, it leads to much poorer sleep
for me (possibly because the energy in the food is released as heat and
excitement when I am sleeping). I don't have a great consistent way to avoid
this problem yet, besides my willpower (which is not consistent :/). Some
tricks that kinda work are:

 - Lining up an engaging activity to do right after I eat, so I don't just
   default to snacking more.
 - Drinking tea or broth after eating as a replacement behavior.

### [Fasting]({{< relref "/docs/health-and-longevity/fasting.md" >}}).

I haven't done a long fast in a while, but am experimenting with fasting one
day a week (Saturday) and still want to do a long fast 3x per year.  

### Diet Composition

I'm playing with using [this eatthismuch meal
plan](https://www.eatthismuch.com/dietset/196607506/) as a general description
of what my food intake looks like. I should probably eat less fat to adhere to
[Valter Longo's
recommendations](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).

#### Confidence Levels

Because it is hard (for me at least) to get good, immediate feedback from my
body about which foods are the "healthiest" for me in the long term, I instead
have to rely on information from other people to figure out what food I should
eat. I'm [working to combat this]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/biomarker-correlator.md" >}}) but realistically
will need to continue to do this for a while. Unfortunately, there are many
opinions out there about what food is healthy, and trusting one necessarily
means discounting others, which might be right. Here I try to be honest with
myself about where my personal opinions come from so that I can more
effectively identify and correct them.

 - ðŸ“º = I've been exposed to a lot of random media supporting this opinion, but
   don't really understand the details.
 - ðŸ“ˆ = This is an interesting statistical trend, but correlation != causation.
 - ðŸ’¡ = This is a plausible idea, but I haven't found evidence that it has
   health effects in humans. In other words, it's [a nice conjecture, but
   requires more criticism]({{< relref
   "/docs/understanding-the-world/influences.md#the-beginning-of-infinity-by-david-deutschhttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_beginning_of_infinity"
   >}}).
 - ðŸ“š = This is the best explanation I know of, and has withstood a good amount
   of criticism, although of course it might still be wrong.
 - ðŸ§  = This is a personal observation I've made about myself.

TODO move these emojis to a more central location so I can use them in other
writings.

#### Meat (non-fish)

I try to avoid eating meat. There are a bunch of weak reasons for this:

1. I perceive the supply chain that produces meat as being messy and
   suffering-causing ðŸ“º. Another way to phrase this is: I don't think I would
   want to run my own personal meat-producing supply chain even if it was
   low-effort.
1. Meat consumption using our current supply chain is energy/space/time
   inefficient compared to other food sources ðŸ“š. I don't think this is a
   problem that we should rely on individual choices to solve (like other
   climate change related problems), so it's a pretty weak reason for an
   individual to not eat meat IMO. Larger systemic changes like taxes on meat
   seem to me like the more effective way to take action on this information.
1. Meat consumption seems be to [weakly associated with
   cancer](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat)
   ðŸ“ˆ and other common causes of death. This may be because of the proteins in
   meat causing up-regulation of growth factors like IGF-1, which may
   accelerate aging ðŸ’¡.
1. The "blue zone" communities around the world with high health- and
   life-spans [eat little
   meat](https://www.bluezones.com/recipes/food-guidelines/) ðŸ“ˆ.

#### Protein

It seems like [low protein consumption (especially animal protein) might slow
aging](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4807119/). See [this
comprehensive macronutrient mouse
study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5087279/). See also this
review: [The impact of dietary protein intake on longevity and metabolic
health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6562018/).

Note that it seems like this is NOT true for people over the age of 65. At this
point, loss of muscle becomes a dangerous problems (leading to falls, etc.), so
the benefits of eating more protein to maintain muscle mass seem to outweigh
the downsides.

#### Fish

I eat fish and other seafood, but rarely (I don't cook it myself).

#### Eggs

I eat ~4 eggs a day ~4 times per week.

#### Dairy

I eat a small amount of yogurt and cheese. I try to avoid all other dairy
products as best I can. My throat is irritated when I drink plain milk and
excessive consumption of any dairy product upsets my digestion, so I think I am
somewhat personally intolerant of at least dairy from cows ðŸ§ .

#### Whole Foods

This includes any food that has not had components stripped from it at a small
scale. For instance, I would consider a berry a whole food even though it was
separated from the plant at the macro scale. But jam would not be a whole food
because it involves removing some fiber and other unknown stuff from the berry
and adding parts of other plants (sugars) that were themselves removed from
their whole plant part.

I like the story I've heard about whole foods ðŸ“º. At the very least, it seems
like we evolved to eat whole foods, so the floor for how bad they can be for us
is fairly high and well known. Note that this theory does **not** say
**anything** suggesting that whole food are the best diet, just that they
aren't that bad.

It also seems well supported and not controversial that eating whole foods
helps delay the onset of the most common causes of death (cardiovascular
disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease) ðŸ“š. 

#### Organic?

I haven't found strong evidence that organic food is healthier than non
organic. But it could be that the right studies just haven't been done yet or I
haven't seen them. Here is an interesting review:

 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5658984/

I buy mostly non organic food because it is cheaper.




## What should I eat and when? (2021)

The most convincing diet structure I've found has been [The Longevity Diet by
Valter Longo](https://www.valterlongo.com/daily-longevity-diet-for-adults/).
This diet is mostly vegan, with fish 2-3 times per week, keeping [protein intake
low](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988204/).  [This
podcast](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cDovL21hcmtiZWxsc3Bvd2VycHJvamVjdC5saWJzeW4uY29tL3Jzcw/episode/MWZmYTNmZDQtNzFjYS00ZjFhLTg4M2YtMjJlZjNhNWFkZjRj?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwj-nLjVwKfwAhVzCjQIHY2XA70QjrkEegQICBAF&ep=6) has
a compelling dissent of Longo's thoughts here; basically it states that Longo's
ideas makes sense, but so do many other ideas and we know now that insufficient
protein can be unhealthy (I need to dig more into this) - the evidence to lower
intake in spite of this is not strong enough yet.  Note that personalizing
protein intake levels while optimizing longevity seems to be possible by
[measuring Blood Urea Nitrogen levels as described by Michael
Lustgarten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u654YTubFRM).

Cool paper about food group epidemiology:
https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/105/6/1462/4569801.

There are a couple of amendments I've made based on my personal experience (in
service of goal 2 above).  These include:

 1. Not eating breakfast.  I find myself most productive in a fasted state
    (even a [prolonged fast](/docs/eating/fasting.md), and eating breakfast breaks be
    right out of this in what otherwise would be a very productive time.  
      - This is counter to Longo's suggestions, some other research on
        circadian rhythms by [Sachin
        Panda](https://doi.org/10.1177/0748730419892105), and the [American
        Heart
        Association](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476).
        The arguments here often revolve around weight loss (which I don't have
        a problem with yet), and don't seem too strong to me.
      - This does help keep a shorter eating window on my day which
        is widely recommended:
          - [Sachin Panda](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.11.004)
 1. Trying to eat grains and/or starchy foods later in the day.  These foods
    uniquely mess with my energy levels.  I'm eager to get some Continuous
    Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data to see if I can quantitate this.  

Some interesting thoughts on meal timing for energy levels can be found at
https://www.workingagainstgravity.com/guides/nutrition-guide/meal-timing.

Other tenants I try to live by:

1. Eating whole foods as much as possible.

### My 2021 Food Strategy

#### Things I try to avoid

 - Dairy
 - Meat
 - Refined carbs (e.g. flour containing foods)
    - [Danger of Fast Carbs](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/carbs-are-killing-us/609040/)
 - Sugars/Syrups


In practice I may have small amounts (<1 "serving") of these things about once
a week.

Note also that avoiding animals products is partially for health reasons
(avoiding cancer primarily), but also partially because the animal food
industry is not easy for me to support.


#### Things I try to moderate

 - Eating more than 1/2 cup of (dry volume) beans or grains at once. A large amount of
   my calories come from these foods - I've just noticed that eating a lot in one
   sitting saps my energy, I assume because they take work to digest.

### One Meal A Day (OMAD)

I tried this for a while, and I found myself falling into the recurring pattern
of overeating because "this is all the food I'll eat today". This is especially
bad with lots of low-calorie-density, high-fiber foods (which I want to eat no
matter what). The overeating would make me feel unfocused and uncomfortable for
4+ hours, which is not worth it for me.

Recently, I've found that a better thought pattern for me is to say "I'll eat
that later" when I get a craving for something right after a meal. This avoids
a state of overeating, and I may later end up not craving that thing, which
means I'll eat less overall that day (which is generally good).

## Hunger, and Physical States of Being

One thing I've noticed is that my body can be in different "states" that affect
my hunger levels. Some examples:

**Induces Hunger**:

 - Sitting around for a while (not moving).
 - Being bored, or not knowing what to do with myself.
 - Eating some food (e.g. a snack sized meal). The effect is more powerful when
   I eat something, then am presented with something of a different flavor
   profile.
 - Overeating will sometimes make me hungry/snack-y for the rest of the day (or
   an extended period of time). I think this is partially because feeling
   overfull makes me less motivated to do stuff, and so I get bored.
 - Working on something that isn't going well. Generally stress. Food is a good
   procrastination tool.

**Suppresses Hunger**:

 - Exercising
 - Being busy
 - Social interaction
 - Taking a shower

One theory I have is that my body gets hungry when it notices that (1) there is
food around and (2) I have time/space to digest after I eat (I wont need to
immediately do something that requires lots of energy).

Some habits that take advantage of this concept include:

 - Distracting myself with busywork when I feed hungry but don't (consciously)
   want to eat.
 - Eating one meal a day, so that I don't have a "snack-train" problem of
   having future meals induce hunger.

### "Snack Train"-ing

One pattern I've noticed in myself that eating food will put me in a
lower-focus mood for 1-4 hours depending on how much and what I ate. If I try
to do something that requires focus in this mood, my body will resist me and
often want to eat more food instead as an alternative activity. Unfortunately,
eating more food will just perpetuate the cycle; in fact it will become even
harder to focus as more of my energy needs to go to digestion.

The key here is to break the cycle by somehow riding through the low energy
mood without pushing myself so much that I want to eat. Sometimes this is
really hard, because doing things that require focus is fulfilling :(. 

I'm basically just writing this as a reminder to myself to push through when
I'm in this mood for the sake of my future self!


## Measuring Personal Dietary Effects

Ideally, I would measure the effects of different foods on my personal health
directly so that I know what works for me (as opposed to what should work
generally).  This takes work unfortunately.  Here are some options that I
should probably explore at some point:

 - [Viome microbiome testing](https://www.viome.com/products/gut-intelligence)
 - [Regular blood testing w/Morgan Levine's biological age
   calculation](https://biohackstack.com/posts/levines-phenotypic-age/).  See
   also [Aging.ai](http://aging.ai/).


## What fats to eat?

Probably mostly mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (not saturated fatty
acids).

 - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.040331
 - https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.038908

## Specific Food Notes

### Sodium

Too much bad.  See [this Kevin Bass video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPRRRQdLUlk) for a
review of studies that show it's beneficial to use part potassium chloride in your salt source.

### Processed Meat

[Carcinogenic according to the
WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat).
[They](https://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about) estimate that 34k cancer deaths
worldwide can be attributed to processed meat, compared to 1mil to smoking,
600k to drinking alcohol, and 200k to air pollution.

### Advanced Glycation End Products

Created by high heat cooking of especially protein-rich foods (e.g. meat/nuts).
But all foods contain.  Ideal to reduce the amount of this eaten.

 - [Michael Lustgarten evidence
   video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gKFWBTpXWE)
 - Great overview/reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3704564/

It would be cool to measure this in blood.  Perhaps a1c inflammation test is a
good proxy.

These are also formed endogenously when sugars react with proteins/fats
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_glycation_end-product). This may be one
of the reasons why sugar is bad for you.

### Flax Seeds

It seems like baking flax seeds will not degrade omega-3 content ([biased
source](https://www.goldenvalleyflax.com/flax-facts/health-research-articles/flaxseed-storage-baking-stability/)).

### Nutritional Yeast

Contains MSG ([probably not
harmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6952072/)) and uric acid
([probably harmful in large quantity](https://peterattiamd.com/rickjohnson/))
([source](https://selfhacked.com/blog/nutritional-yeast/)).  Also is a fairly
processed food.
