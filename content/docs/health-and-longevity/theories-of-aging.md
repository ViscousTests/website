# Theories of Aging

## Information Theory of Aging

Over time, small defects in our epigenome build up as proteins constantly fix
DNA damage.  This leads to cells becoming less differentiated (skin cells act
less like skin cells for example), which leads to symptoms of aging.

## Microbial Burden

Over time, the presence of toxic microbial-generated chemicals accumulate in
our bodies, causing symptoms of aging. The entry point of these chemicals is
mostly through our degrading gut lining, but can be found in other places as
well (skin/mouth/etc.).

## SENS

We don't know or care what the root cause of aging is, but we do know there are
(at least) 7 types of damage that it causes. If we can fix those, probably the
negative symptoms of aging will go away.

See https://www.sens.org/our-research/intro-to-sens-research/ for information
about the types of damage, and the latest progress towards repairing them.

## Reproductive Window

I **think** (based on Charles Brenner's comments in his debate with Aubrey de
Grey) that [Michael Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_R._Rose)
proposes that evolutionary attention has not been paid to organisms after they
reproduce, so aging occurs because all the systems that keep an organism alive
after its reproductive window are not evolution-optimized, and are therefore
dysfunctional.
