# Aging Overview

## Why is Aging Important?

It indirectly kills the vast majority of people, and will most likely kill you.
It kills by slowly disabling the body and the mind over many years, leading to
a massive amount of unnecessary physical and emotional suffering.

## Defeating Aging

The human body, like the global economy, is a complex system of many moving
parts: https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00252-6.
Therefore, it reacts in unpredictable, non-linear ways when exposed to changes.
This makes it resilient, but also counter-intuitive to "fix".
As an example, [~90% of clinical drug trials
fail](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383522000521),
despite (presumably) all of them starting out with a good story for why they
should succeed.
This is important to keep in mind when considering ways to defeat aging -
[reasonable sounding theories will most likely be wrong]({{< relref
"/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md" >}}) and need to be tested
before trusting them.

See [Theories of Aging]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/theories-of-aging.md" >}}) for some specific
ideas for why aging might occur.

### Lifestyle Optimization

[Exercising]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/exercise.md" >}}), [sleeping well]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/sleep.md" >}}), [eating intentionally]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/food.md" >}}), [reducing cronic stress]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/chronic-stress.md" >}}), among other things all
can delay the effects of aging.
Regular fxercise, for one, probably has the potential to [add 1-7 years to your
life](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3395188/).

However, these kinds of optimizations have not been seen to dramatically extend
lifespan beyond 80-90 years.
