## General Cooking Tips

If you're interested in experimenting with new food combinations, one technique
that has served me pretty well I call the "trifecta of flavor".  The way it
works is you take two foods that go well together (e.g. banana and peanut
butter) and you add a third food that goes well with one of the foods but would
be weird to combine with the other (e.g. spinach in this case).  More often
than not, the result is actually pretty good!

## Microwave Steam Bowls

A really easy and convenient way to make some pretty tasty (and healthy!) food.
The basic premise is that you add your vegetables with a splash of water to a
bowl, cover it with a plate, and microwave for 5-8 minutes. Then you add extra
flavors and enjoy! It's easy to get creative with the cooking technique, but
here are some examples:

### Carrots/Onions

Chop carrots and onions, add water and cook, finish with almond butter and
salt.  Add chia seeds optionally to soak up the water!

### Thai Carrots/Onions

Same recipe as before, but instead of almond butter, use natural (e.g. Adams)
peanut butter with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and optionally lime juice.

### Honey Walnut Shrimp Inspired

Chop cabbage, add water and cook with brown rice, finish with walnuts and
mayonnaise. 

## Staples

### Flax Peanut Butter

Mixing ground flaxseed and natural peanut butter in around a 1:1 ratio makes a
great nut butter!  You'll need to add some water to make it a paste (and not
just powdery).  

This recipe has a good omega-3/6 ratio too.  Per 100g, peanut butter has 9.7g
omega-6 and 0.3g omega-3 fatty acids.  Per 100g, flax seeds have 5.9g omega-6
and 22.8g omega-3 fatty acids.  So combined, we have 23.1g omega3 and 15.6g
omega-6, a **~1.5 ratio**!  Data was taken from NCCDB via Cronometer.

### Oats

 - 1 cup rolled oats
 - 2 cups water
 - Some salt

Boil water, add oats, cook for 5 mins on stovetop.  Watch out for boiling over
in first couple minutes!  Can also microwave for 3 mins.

To make overnight oats, use the same ratios, but just leave the oats in the
fridge overnight instead of cooking. I highly recommend addng chia seeds and/or
coconut and/or some other kind of nut + some fruit when making overnight oats.
Yogurt is also good.

### Roasted Vegetables

All at 425F.

Vegetable      | Size     | Time (mins)
---------      | -------- | -----------
Potato         | 1/2 in   | 40 - 50
Zucchini       | 1/2 in   | 20
Broccoli       | floret   | 20
Brussel Sprout | halved   | 20
Tomato (roma)  | sliced   | 15

chart](https://www.myfrugalhome.com/vegetable-roasting-times-chart/).

Add thyme, rosemary, salt, garlic for extra flavor!  Add olive oil after or
before.

### Soup

Saute (cook) onions, carrots, and/or celery for ~5 minutes in a soup pot with
some olive oil.  Add garlic and cook for ~1 more minute.

Next, add a bunch of either stock or water with stock concentrate (e.g. "Better
Than Bullion") and add chopped ingredients to boil based on this time table:

Ingredient      | Time (mins)
---------       | -----------
Beans           | 90-120 + presoaking overnight
Greens          | 3-5
Green beans     | 3
Lentils         | 25
Potatoes        | 20
Barley          | 50
Pasta           | 8-12
Brown Rice      | 45
White Rice      | 15

This table is also accurate for just boiling anything - not necessarily as a
part of a soup.
