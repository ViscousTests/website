# Health Behavior Change Pitfalls

Here I document pitfalls I've noticed that prevent myself and others from
becoming healthier.

## Taking the personally wrong approach, and not realizing it

Probably the most common and insidious pitfall I've fallen into (and seen others
fall into) goes something like this:

1. You read something or get some feedback that inspires a change.
   _For example, you read that doing more Zone 2 cardio training than you are
   doing now would probably make you healthier._
2. Decide (usually quickly) on a strategy to make said change.
   _"I'm going to go jogging every day for 30 minutes."_
3. Try to execute the strategy and fail.
   There are lots of common reasons for failure:
   - No positive effects were noticed.
   - The strategy was annoying or boring.
   - The strategy was physically uncomfortable/painful.
   - The strategy was time consuming.
   - The strategy was too daunting to attempt.
4. **You incorrectly attribute your failure to a lack of willpower or an
   immutable character/identity flaw.**
5. You give up, and come away from the whole experience with a negative
   impression, thinking thoughts like:
   - _"People who do this are crazy"_
   - _"It doesn't matter anyway (I didn't notice any benefits)"_
   - _"I feel ashamed that I couldn't do this thing that is so easy for others"_
6. You start preemptively ignoring/avoiding inspirations to do similar things in
   the future, because of the negative impression.

The core pitfall here is step (2) which then causes step (4).
In my experience, **there are usually many more strategies that it first appears
to meet a health goal**.

Moreover, these strategies often work way better or worse for different people
depending on lots of factors.
Even the same actions framed differently can have dramatically different success
rates.
For instance,

 - "run for 30 minutes"
 - "run home from work"
 - "run around the lake"
 - "try to beat my speed record for a route"
 - "run for 30 minutes with a friend"
 - "run a trail"
 - "try out some new shoes for 30 minutes"
 - "try out this new running technique I read a book about and thought was
   interesting"
 - "play a game of soccer with friends"
 - "play a game of soccer and try hard to win"
 - "run with my sports team as a part of conditioning training"
 - "run and track my heart rate / time to watch the numbers go down" All could
   lead to the exact same action, but be much more or less doable depending on
   the person.

I know for me personally some of the stuff on this list sounds terrible, and
some sounds great.
And this is just variations on one activity!
Usually there are also a ton of different activities that would lead to the same
health goal.

Therefore, it's likely that if instead of reacting as in step (4), going back to
step (2) right away - or spending more time at step (2) in the first place -
would lead to a lower probability of failure in step (3).
