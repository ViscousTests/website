# Health Behavior Change Pitfalls

Here I document pitfalls I've noticed that prevent myself and others from
becoming healthier.

## Taking the personally wrong approach, and not realizing it

Probably the most common and insidious pitfall I've fallen into (and seen others
fall into) goes something like this:

1. You read something or get some feedback that inspires you to make a
   health-related change in your life.
   For example:
   - _You read that doing more Zone 2 cardio training than you are doing now
     would probably make you healthier._
   - _You have a mediocre blood glucose test and decide to eat more fiber._
2. Decide (usually quickly) on a strategy to make said change.
   For example:
   - _"I'm going to go jogging every day for 30 minutes."_
   - _"I'm going to eat a salad for breakfast every day."_
3. Try to execute the strategy and fail.
   There are lots of general common reasons for failure:
   - No positive effects were noticed.
   - The strategy was annoying or boring.
   - The strategy was physically uncomfortable/painful.
   - The strategy was time consuming.
   - The strategy was too daunting to attempt.
     For example:
   - _"During and after my first 30 minute run my joints hurt a lot."_
   - _"I felt super bloated and low energy after my 2nd day easing breakfast
     salads.
     And I hate their taste."_
4. **You incorrectly attribute your failure to a lack of willpower or an
   immutable character/identity flaw.**  For example:
   - _"I'm not cut out for running.
     I don't have the will to push through the pain."_
   - _"I can't deal with the discomfort of the salads over my normal breakfast,
     which I'm now craving a lot."_
5. You give up, and come away from the whole experience with a negative
   impression, thinking thoughts like:
   - _"Runners are crazy people who enjoy pain."_
   - _"The salads made me feel worse, not better, and I can't resist my prior
     cravings."_
   - _"I'm ashamed I couldn't control myself and stick to my new habits with
     willpower."_
   - _"This habit does not fit into my identity - I'm not the kind of person who
     can do it."_
   - <insert thoughts of self-loathing here>
   - _"These new habits wouldn't have helped me much anyway."_
6. You start preemptively ignoring/avoiding inspirations to do similar things in
   the future, because of the negative impression.

The core pitfall here is step (2) which then causes step (4).
In my experience, failing in step (3) is almost always because I did a bad job
in step (2) picking my strategy, **not because a failure in my ability to
execute**.

For me at least, but I expect for everyone, different strategies work way better
or worse than others depending on lots of factors, **many impossible to fully
understand**.

Therefore, it's likely that if instead of reacting as in step (4), going back to
step (2) right away - or spending more time at step (2) in the first place -
would lead to a lower probability of failure in step (3).

Luckily, **there are usually many more strategies that it first appears to meet
a health goal**.
This is great, because it means that failure with one strategy does not mean you
are out of options - you can just try something else!
Even better, this means you are free to go into step (3) with **extremely low
expectations, even expecting to fail**, since failure is cheap.

The worst thing to do is become dead set on a single strategy you build up as
the only solution in step (2), then try really really hard to make it work in
step (3).
This will lead to a brutal step (4) if the dice don't fall in your favor.

### Reframing Approaches to the Same Strategy

A related observation: even the same strategies framed differently can have
dramatically different success rates.
For instance,

 - "run for 30 minutes"
 - "run home from work"
 - "run around the lake"
 - "try to beat my speed record for a route"
 - "run for 30 minutes with a friend"
 - "run a trail"
 - "try out some new shoes for 30 minutes"
 - "try out this new running technique I read a book about and thought was
   interesting"
 - "play a game of soccer with friends"
 - "play a game of soccer and try hard to win"
 - "run with my sports team as a part of conditioning training"
 - "run and track my heart rate / time to watch the numbers go down" All could
   lead to the exact same action, but be much more or less doable depending on
   the person.

I know for me personally some of the stuff on this list sounds terrible, and
some sounds great.
