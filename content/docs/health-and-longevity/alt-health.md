# Alt-Health: A Critique

## What is Alt-Health?

I'm defining "alt-health" as a general movement of people on the internet who
feel that the modern healthcare system ("healthcare 2.0" in Peter Attia's
parlance) is "broken" or not meeting the needs of society.
Specifically, these people cite the growing incidence of chronic disease - e.g.
obesity - in our population, and criticize how the modern healthcare system is
really a "sick-care" system that specializes in managing symptoms of chronic
disease, as opposed to preventing that disease in the first place.

I generally agree with this overarching theme, and consider myself part of this
movement to some extent.
However, I have become worried by the lack of rigorous science (and thought)
that goes into many "alt-health" positions.
I want to explore this more in this post.

## Inspiration and Backstory

I was inspired to write this when listening to
https://thenuggetclimbing.com/episodes/kaizen-asiedu; a "Nugget Climbing"
podcast episode that talks a lot about the health in America.
This episode specifically focused a lot on RFK, jr., a quintessential
"alt-health"-er who has just come to some power in the Trump administration.

In the episode, the host tells a story about how he had psoriasis on the back of
his head.
He describes going to a doctor, being told the condition was untreatable, and
being given a steroid to apply topically for the rest of his life to manage
symptoms.
Then, the host describes how he started reading more "alt-health" content and
started experimenting with his diet.
Miraculously, this experimentation led to a dramatic reduction in symptoms (much
more than the steroid)!
The host concludes his story by discussing how this experience made him feel a
bit betrayed by the healthcare system, and much more interested in "alt-health"
takes.

Funnily enough, I have a story from my own life that almost perfectly parallels
the host's.
In high school I played football and wore these tight padded undershorts 5+ days
a week for practice and games.
I think something about this triggered a bad eczema on my inner thighs that
persisted for about a decade after I stopped playing football.
Like the host, I went to a doctor and had the exact same experience: "your
condition is incurable, here is a steroid".
Then, like the host, I started reading about and experimenting with diet, and
also made my eczema completely go away.
For me, it seemed like eliminating dairy from my diet was the main driver of my
cure.

I also felt a bit betrayed by the doctor - the word "incurable" so strongly
echoed in my mind and made me feel terrible and defeatist about my condition.
The fact that it was in fact curable despite what the doctor said was a relief,
but also made me feel bad that I had to live with the defeatist attitude about
an uncomfortable condition for so long.

## Interlude: Effect Size

Before going into different influences of health, I want to quickly describe
what I find to be a useful way to rank these influences: comparing effect size.

Effect size is simply the size of the effect you expect a health intervention to
have.
For instance, for me, eliminating dairy made my eczema go from 100% to 0%, a
large effect.
I have yet to notice any effect from Vitamin D supplements I've been recently
taking, but soon I'll have a blood test that will quantify how much my blood
levels have changed (hopefully due to the supplement...).
This effect size hopefully I'll be able to map to health outcomes I actually
care about.

Researchers use effect size to describe the efficacy of drugs or other
interventions so that they can be approved (or banned) for general use by a body
like the FDA.

Note that it is quite common for there to be a reasonable explanation for why
something should impact health (e.g. a molecular mechanism), but for the actual
effect size to be zero or even negative.
Many, many billions of dollars are continuously and painfully spent on drug
trials that fail in probably the best illustration of this phenomenon.

Keeping effect size in mind is a good way to consistency judge things that
impact health, and helps prevent getting distracted by the reasonable
explanations.

## Specificity: An Alt-Health Tendency

As I have read books and articles about how to be healthier, emboldened by my
eczema cure, I have noticed some worrying trends in the alt-health space.
Specifically, it seems many alt-health-ers love to pick out very specific causes
of health problems without evidence of a noticeable effect size in real people.
These include:

 - MSG and "excitotoxins"
 - Glyphosate and other herbicides
 - "GMO" foods
 - Non-organic foods generally
 - [Seed oils](https://dynomight.net/seed-oil/)
 - Preservatives
 - "Anti-nutrients" like oxalates and phytates
 - Microplastics and teflon

I see this happening for interventions that benefit health too:

 - Most supplements (flagship example: resveratrol)
 - Some specific diets that make sweeping generalizations, like the blood type
   diet

It's entirely possible that some of these things actually do have a measurable
effect size that I haven't found in the literature yet; if they do please let me
know!

I suspect people keep doing this for several reasons, depending on the
cause/intervention:

1. Because it is neat and simple to say "if we only got rid of this, we would be
   so much healthier".
2. The reasonable explanations (not based on scientific data) are convincing.
3. A low level disgust response.
   "Eating plastic" sounds bad to the primitive parts of our brain.

## Unspecific Cures

To be fair, many "alt-health"-ers (like me) are also big fans of less "specific"
interventions that **do** have a well studied and measurable effect size.
These include:

 - Daily exercise, low and high intensity
 - A sufficient amount of good quality sleep
 - Consumption of whole foods like:
   - Fruits
   - Vegetables
   - Whole grains
   - Fish
   - Meat (controversial), including stuff beyond muscle like organs
 - Avoiding processed foods and hyper-palatable foods that make it easy to
   overeat.
   Note that these foods can be helpful if you require them to stay in energy
   balance, such as when being very physically active.
 - Avoiding chronic stress, e.g. from a stressful job, social media, and/or
   their commute.
   Or at least being able to manage stress well.
 - Avoiding chronic exposure to poor air quality, including smoking
 - Avoiding excess alcohol consumption
 - Avoiding chronic high blood pressure, e.g. from high salt/stress
 - Avoiding heart disease risk markers, like high apoB, e.g. from diet

## Big Pharma and Doctors: Corrupted?

Many alt-health-ers have a strong distaste of the pharma industry, and use of
drugs in general.
In the most extreme case, their story is that pharma companies only care about
profit, and would prefer to keep many people in a state of chronic disease
managed by drugs to make the most money.
Additionally, the story goes that doctors are complicit in this, and prescribe
drugs to fix problems because they are also sucked in by the profit motive.

I personally challenge this interpretation.
One of the best alternative explanations I've heard from doctors is that they
are as frustrated as anyone else, but are unable to effectively prescribe the
"alt-health" "unspecific cures" listed above because:

1. Patient compliance is low
   - People don't want to change their diet
   - People don't want to exercise
   - People don't want to - or can't - quit their stressful job
   - People like hyper-palatable food, alcohol, nicotine, etc.
2. Some unspecific cures are hard to study, or the effect size varies
   dramatically patient to patient, leading to more time/energy required to
   effectively prescribe them (and doctors are overworked/don't have this time)
   - For instance, many people tolerate dairy quite well, but I do not.
     Most primary care providers do have have time to suss things like this out
     for every patient.
3. Most "alt-health" specific cures have low or unknown effect sizes, so
   prescribing them is a gamble that will probably not pay off and may do harm.
