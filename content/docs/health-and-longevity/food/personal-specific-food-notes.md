# Personal Specific Food Notes

How I personally react to different foods in 2025.

## Animal Products

 - **Fish:** Often make me feel tired/sleepy when digesting.
   Not great to overeat on.
   I like to eat regularly for the omega-3s.
   - I tolerate sardines and salmon better than tuna for some reason.
 - **Dairy:** Makes me gassy and generally not feel great.
   This is most pronounced with milk and some cheese.
   Least pronounced with heavy cream.
 - **Eggs:** No issues, although can take longer to digest than other foods; not
   great to eat them if my next meal will be soon.

## Legumes

 - **Tofu:** No issues digesting.
 - **Beans/Chickpeas/Lentils:** When I eat these plain, I tend to stay hungry
   for a while and eat a lot of them.
   This invariably leads to me feeling very overfull and tired, as they are also
   hard for me to digest.
 - **Peanut Products:** Good in small quantities, but very easy to overdo.
   - **Peanut Butter:** Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many
     hours afterward as I digest.
   - **Peanuts:** Generally make me feel ok when I eat them.
   - **Peanut Protein Powder:** I tolerate this really well even in higher
     quantities, making me think that the oil in peanuts is the main thing I
     react poorly too.

## Grains

 - **Rolled Oats:** I love oats and even eat them raw.
   I don't have any issues eating/digesting them.
 - **Brown Rice:** Good in small quantities, too much can make me feel bloated.
 - **White Rice:** Similar to brown rice, and can make me feel tired when eating
   too much, which is easy to do.

## Fruits

 - **Apples:** No issues here!
 - **Bananas:** For some reason, eating bananas alone can give me a short-lived
   headache and seems to mess with my energy.

## Vegetables

 - **Pickled Onions:** Upset my stomach except in very small quantities.
   I should avoid them generally.
 - **Onions:** Eating more than a small onion will make me feel kinda bloated.
   Mild effect.
 - **Cabbage:** I love cabbage, and it seems to be very easy for me to digest.
 - **Broccoli:** Good in smaller quantities, too much can make me feel bloated.

## Roots

 - **Potatoes**: I tolerate these well!

## Nuts/Seeds

 - **Nut Butters:** Very easy for me to overeat and feel really bad for many
   hours afterward as I digest.
 - **Chia Seeds:** I love chia seeds and have no issues eating them.
 - **Almonds:** Good, just don't eat too many.
 - **Walnuts:** Good, just don't eat too many.
