# Personal Food Habits

Here I outline what eating habits work well/poorly for me personally.

See [Personal Specific Food Notes]({{< relref
"/docs/health-and-longevity/food/personal-specific-food-notes.md" >}}) for
information about how specific foods affect me.

## Current Habits (8/2025)

### Schedule

 - **Breakfast:** 9am.
   Mostly berries/fruit, with also a small amount of fatty yogurt, cream,
   coconut milk, or chia pudding.
   Avoid oats or any whole grains/beans.
   Avoid high protein or starch foods (eggs/potatoes).
   Some smoked salmon is OK.
   Don't eat too much!!
   Overeating at breakfast is a good way to derail energy for the rest of the
   day.
 - **Lunch:** 12pm.
   Salad with some chickpeas, fish.
   Also a good amount of bread.
   Avoid rice.
 - **Dinner:** eat only if hungry OR if I worked out in the afternoon/evening.
   Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, some legumes, avoid too much protein and
   salt!
   This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy,
   digesting protein/salt keeps me awake).
    - E.g. Lots of raw tofu on bread made me sleep poorly

### Setting

I used to eat a lot of my meals while watching YouTube videos, browsing social
media, or talking to other people I was sharing the meal with.
I found that the extra stimulation/low grade stress from these activities often
led me to lose track of my eating and/or overeat.

Recently I've been experimenting with disconnecting entirely when eating and
focusing only on the food.
Usually this entails going outside and eating there.
This has helped a lot to curb overeating, and gives me some time to consider
what I have coming up in the day.
I think I want to continue doing this as much as I can!

## Past Habits (6/2025)

### Schedule

 - **Breakfast:** Avoid grains/beans.
   Eat a small amount of vegetables with oil.
   Eat eggs/fish.
   Don't eat too much!!
   Overeating at breakfast is a good way to derail energy for the rest of the
   day.
 - **Lunch:** eat one, but try to wait until hungry again from breakfast.
   This could be 5+ hours later.
   Eat a mixed variety, with more carbs than breakfast.
   Still avoid grains/beans if possible.
   Eating only fats/greens (like salad) can lead to low energy and continued
   hunger.
 - **Dinner:** eat only if hungry OR if I worked out in the afternoon/evening.
   Focus on mainly whole grain carbs, fruit, some legumes, avoid too much
   protein and salt!
   This is to avoid disturbing sleep (I find whole grains make me sleepy,
   digesting protein/salt keeps me awake).
    - *Enforcement mechanism:* I have a calendar event every day starting at
      5:30 that reminds me of this item.
