# SENS

SENS attempts to clean up damage that accumulates with age, in the hopes that
doing so will lead to longer life.  See
https://www.sens.org/our-research/intro-to-sens-research/ for a good overview
of the methods.

## Charles Brenner vs Aubrey de Grey Debate

The debate was held on the [Let's Talk
Longevity](https://www.letstalklongevity.com/) podcast.

My understanding is that Brenner does not like that there is no direct evidence
that if any of the damage SENS is trying to clean up will lead to positive
health outcomes.  His view is that the SENS program is a set of ["plausible
ideas"]({{< relref "/docs/understanding-the-world/what-to-believe.md" >}})
without enough evidence behind them to warrant funding or pursuit.
