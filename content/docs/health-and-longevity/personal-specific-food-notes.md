# Personal Specific Food Notes

Here I catalog how specific foods affect my body.

## Legumes

 - Prone to put me in a "snack train" mood.

## Broccoli/Cauliflower

 - Eating too much will upset my stomach

## Milk/Cream

 - Drinking milk irritates my throat
 - Eating too much will upset my stomach

## Onions

 - Eating too much will upset my stomach
 - Not as bad as other foods I'm sensitive to

## Potatoes

 - I tolerate these well
