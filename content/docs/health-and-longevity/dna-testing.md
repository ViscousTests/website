# DNA Testing

It seems like AncestryDNA gives the biggest bang-for-buck in terms of SNPs to
analyze via promethease or foundmyfitness based on
https://geneticgenie.org/article/best-dna-raw-data-23andme-ancestrydna-or-myheritage/.

Promethease seems to have been bought and paired down in the info it returns
based on
https://www.reddit.com/r/promethease/comments/bczfcb/alternatives_to_promethease/.

I analyzed my AncestryDNA data with several services:

 - Free reports from https://www.foundmyfitness.com/genetics 
   - Really easy to read and well summarized reports!
 - Free search from https://codegen.eu/faq/
   - Not as user friendly, but a good search engine.
