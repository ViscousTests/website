# Continuous Glucose Monitoring

Continuous glucose monitoring is really cool because it gives a continuous look
inside your body. This kind of biomarker is rare, and it feels like there is a
lot of info that can be gleaned from this kind of data.

A great article about what CGM might be able to tell us can be found at

An interesting anecdote about GCM learnings can be found at

## My Usage

I tried out a Freestyle Libre CGM that I was prescribed by my doctor
(surprisingly, it was fully covered by my high-deductible insurance too!). 

I was hoping to see clear correlation between my energy/focus levels and my
blood glucose, but didn't really.

TODO add plots here showing food consumption and CGM data.
