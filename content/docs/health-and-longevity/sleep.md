# Sleep

Some tips and tricks that work for me to get better sleep.

## Smart Alarm

[Sleep as Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) has a feature where instead
of setting an alarm to go off at 8am, you tell the app to wake you up say
between 7am and 8am.  Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a
lighter sleep phase.  I've found this to be **way** more pleasant than waking
up at a fixed time.  In fact, I've found that I more naturally wake up by
myself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body
associates it with lighter sleep.

This app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.

## Causes of Bad Sleep

### Racing Mind

Anything that causes me to be constantly thinking about something will usually
interrupt my sleep.  This includes:

 - Trying to make sure I remember something that I need to do tomorrow.  See
   [Task Tracking]({{< relref "/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/task-tracking.md">}})
   for an excellent solution to this problem.
 - Worrying about an event or something that I need to wake up for (like a
   flight).
 - Worrying about a personal conflict or argument, or any kind of unresolved
   tension between me and someone else. 
 - Trying to sleep right after doing an activity I was really engaged in, like
   playing a game. This will happen if my mind is continuing to ponder the
   decisions I was making in the activity, or if it's re-remembering parts of
   the activity (and e.g. how I could have done them better).

### Food

Eating more that ~1/3 of my daily calories, especially from fatty foods, in the
5-6 hours before sleeping will often lead to me getting overheated and sweaty
after being asleep for a couple hours. This is especially true if it's
otherwise cold in the room where I'm sleeping and I need to tuck myself in more
tightly to my blankets.

Eating a big (fatty) breakfast and either an early dinner (like 4pm) or no
dinner helps with this.

Caffeine definitely does not help me sleep :).

### Dirty Sheets

Clean sheets, or specifically sheets that I haven't sweated in before make it
much less likely that I will sweat when sleeping (all else being equal), which
in turn will make me sleep better.

### Temperature and Airflow

#### Skin Stimulation

For me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my
sleep quality.  For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and
keeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or
otherwise stimulate my skin.

In practice, I best accomplish this by:

1. Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don't get
   uncomfortably cold.
1. Wearing boxers.
1. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise "warm-feeling" sheets to that my
   skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to
   fluctuations in air temperature or movement.

#### Cold

One common pattern I fall into that leads to poor sleep is being too cold when
going to sleep. This leads me to tightly hug my arms close to my self and tuck
my sheets up to my neck (holding onto them with my hands). While this is
comfortable when going to sleep, I find that it leads me to overheat once I
actually do fall asleep. This leads to me getting sweaty, and then cold and
uncomfortable.  I feel a similar effect when using sleeping bags or wearing
a shirt when going to bed.

Due to this pattern, I find that it's paradoxically better for me to use more
blankets and/or a heated mattress pad and fall asleep in a more relaxed posture
with looser sheets/more airflow. This is less likely to cause the overheating ->
sweaty -> cold/uncomfortable issue.

In addition to making me bundle myself too tightly when going to sleep, being
cold also just generally stimulates my mind/body, which hinders my ability to
fall asleep.

I've found a good way to manage cold is to use a heated mattress pad or heated
blanket to pre-warm my bed, which helps me feel relaxed and warm as I get into
bed.  Then, right before going to sleep, I turn off the heat and make sure I
have enough warm blankets around in case I do end up cooling down. 

#### Showering

Taking a shower generally gives me temperature sensitive skin that makes it
hard to find a good equilibrium when falling asleep, making it more likely that
I'll get too cold or overheat later in the night.

Going to sleep with wet hair from a shower also can exacerbate temperature
issues. At the very least it make my pillow wet, which is annoying.

I find that showering ~2 hours before sleeping makes these non-issues.


## Interesting Trends

Several behaviors seem to correlate with dream presence and intensity for me in
a dose-dependent way:

 - Playing video games in the evening, especially role-playing type games.
 - Having eaten a lot of food during the day/evening.
