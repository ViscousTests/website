# Sleep

Some tips and tricks that work for me to get better sleep.

## Smart Alarm

[Sleep as Android](https://sleep.urbandroid.org/) has a feature where instead
of setting an alarm to go off at 8am, you tell the app to wake you up say
between 7am and 8am.  Then the app uses your movements to wake you up during a
lighter sleep phase.  I've found this to be **way** more pleasant than waking
up at a fixed time.  In fact, I've found that I more naturally wake up by
myself in the morning right before the alarm goes off, as if my body
associates it with lighter sleep.

This app also tracks my sleep, which is kinda useful sometimes.

## Temperature and Airflow

For me I find that keeping my skin calm makes a big difference to my
sleep quality.  For me, this means keeping myself a proper temperature and
keeping myself protected from breezes and other forces that can tickle or
otherwise stimulate my skin.

In practice, I best accomplish this by:

1. Wearing socks or lower-leg warmers to sleep so that my feet don't get
   uncomfortably cold.
1. Wrapping myself with flannel or otherwise "warm-feeling" sheets to that my
   skin is constantly in contact with something constant and not exposed to
   fluctuations in air temperature or movement.

One common pattern I fall into that leads to poor sleep is being too cold when
going to sleep. This leads me to tightly hug my arms close to my self and tuck
my sheets up to my neck (holding onto them with my hands). While this is
comfortable when going to sleep, I find that it leads me to overheat once I
actually do fall asleep. This leads to me getting sweaty, and then cold and
uncomfortable.  I feel a similar effect when using sleeping bags or wearing
cloths when going to bed.

Due to this pattern, I find that it's paradoxically better for me to use more
blankets and/or a heated mattress pad and fall asleep in a more relaxed posture
with looser sheets/more airflow. This is less likely to cause the overheating ->
sweaty -> cold/uncomfortable issue.

Going to sleep with wet hair from a shower might exacerbate temperature issues.
At the very least it make my pillow wet, which is annoying.

## Activities

Playing FPS or other games within and hour or so of sleeping can make it harder
to fall asleep, but may not affect sleep quality after falling asleep.
