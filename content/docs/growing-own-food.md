## Hydroponics for leafy greens

Most leafy greens should take [about a
month](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/quick-growing-plants-hydroponic-systems-27438.html#:~:text=best%20for%20you.-,Lettuce,ready%20as%20the%20leafy%20types.)
to grow hydroponically.  Therefore, if I want to eat two plants a day, I need
60 plant growing stations in my system.  This is a 10x6 system, which seems
fairly small actually.

To make things easy, it would be cool to come up with a reusable solution for
the material to plant the seeds in, since I would be harvesting and replanting
2 per day.  Could use [mixture of course soils](https://youtu.be/jYOlzqIq9OM)
for this!
