## Builds

### Smite Spell Cleric

This build punishes bad players who try to just melee fight you really hard.

I fought a geared ranger in squire gear once who hit me with a ton of arrows
then tried to finish me off with an arming sword and died even though I was at
around half health.

Use (at squire):

 - Morning star / buckler
 - Spellbook or magic staff
 - 295 move speed armor - plate chest and light pants / boots
 - Smite, then lesser heal, protection, holy strike, locust swarm
   - Really mostly you will just be using lesser heal and maybe protection.
     Other players who are good will just run away and reset if you hit them
     with an offensive spell.
 - Advanced healing, blunt weapon mastery, faithfulness, perseverance.

Focus on getting in melee range and using smite.
If you take too much chip damage, get in cover and use lesser heal.
Sometimes this will bait people to push you, which you can punish by switching
back to melee.

### Hybrid Warlock

Been trying to make a crystal sword casting warlock work.
Idea is that you can curse or bolt right before and after a melee engagement to
get extra damage in, but then also do ok in the melee exchange.

Really this build does not feel good as of Summer 2025.

#### Vs plate fighter / cleric / heavy barbarian

Just take out your spellbook and kite, using phantomize if necessary.
Don't try to melee, even if they are low - it's a trap and they can kill you if
you miss.

#### Vs Ranger or caster wizard / warlock / sorcerer

Close gap with phantomize and try to melee, cursing when they try to run away.

#### Vs Druid

Best footsies wins!

#### Vs Speed barbarian

Land a curse and hope you win the melee.  Maybe try to block?
