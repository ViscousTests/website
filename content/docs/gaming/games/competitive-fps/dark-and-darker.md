## Builds

### Hybrid Warlock

Been trying to make a crystal sword casting warlock work.
Idea is that you can curse or bolt right before and after a melee engagement to
get extra damage in, but then also do ok in the melee exchange.

#### Vs plate fighter / cleric / heavy barbarian

Just take out your spellbook and kite, using phantomize if necessary.
Don't try to melee, even if they are low - it's a trap and they can kill you if
you miss.

#### Vs Ranger or caster wizard / warlock / sorcerer

Close gap with phantomize and try to melee, cursing when they try to run away.

#### Vs Druid

Best footsies wins!

#### Vs Speed barbarian

Land a curse and hope you win the melee.  Maybe try to block?
