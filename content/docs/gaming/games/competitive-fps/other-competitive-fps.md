# Competitive FPS Games

Games where you compete with others in matches.

## Counter Strike

Wingman is my favorite way to play.

Counter strafing is very good / important to do!

## Rainbow 6: Siege

### Summary

Very intense and engaging game that requires a high level of focus.
Every movement made in this game produces audible sound, meaning that movement
gives away your position and makes you vulnerable.
However, like in most shooters,if you proactively move to shoot at a particular
point, you will still have an advantage against someone reacting to your
movement.

This leads to a dynamic where both you and your opponent are trying to determine
the location of the other without giving away their own location - once one
person knows withc ertainty they can simply move to attack and will have a strong
advantage.This dynamic is framed by the asymmetric nature of all game modes,
which have attacking and defending sides.
Attackers must move to engage the defenders, meaning that they start out
disadvantaged (they are moving and making noise while defenders are not).
To counter this, attackers all have remote control drones that make noise when
they move around.
These are easily destroyed, but can be used to determine the locations of
defenders, giving attackers advantage.

### Tips

#### Angles to Hold

 - Long angles, longer the better
 - Angles with wierd elevation

#### Angles NOT to Hold

 - Short angles
     - Instead, play next to the angle and peek when you hear movement on the
       other side.
       Works best with a shotgun.

## Apex Legends

A fast-paced first person shooter video game.
Has extremely good art direction, smooth gameplay, and balanced mechanics.
Is also very hard.

### Strategy

#### "Bowl" Concept

Many Overwatch maps have bowl shaped sections where there is an objective
surrounded by high ground or buildings.
Fighting in the center of the bowl is often very dangerous because you can be
attacked from multiple directions at once.
Because of this, it might be a good rule of thumb to fight on the edges of the
bowl either against others on the edge or, ideally, against enemies in the
center of the bowl.
Likewise, it might be good to be aware of when you are in the bowl and make sure
you can easily get out!

#### Scorpion Formation

The tank is the head, the DPS are the two pincers, and the supports are the body and tail.

 - One DPS is always on the left of the tank, one is always on the right
     - This should help put maximum pressure on the enemy formation; it's harder
       to defend against two directions of attack than one!
 - One support focuses primarily on healing the tank at all times, the other flexes

#### Communication

Led by a support, since they have the best view of the battle.
The communication leader should call when the team is changing "states":

 - **Regroup**: Don't fight the enemy, fall back (into spawn if necessary) and
   wait for teammates to respawn.
     - This should happen when the team has a numbers disadvantage.
 - **Poke**: Tentatively push up and try to get into power positions or the right formation.
     - When this state is called, the leader should also say where the tank will go ("left",
       "right", "center").  Most maps have 2-4 choices for how to move out from spawn; use
       more precise descriptions if necessary. The team should then flow around the tank
       based on whatever formation is being used. 
 - **Go HAM / Fire at Will**: Just attack whoever is easiest to hit or you have
   the best advantage against.
     - This should happen when the team has a numbers advantage.

Ideally the team will respect the state that it is in and behave accordingly to avoid trickling.

This game was pretty mindless but at least it let me [make a YouTube video with
