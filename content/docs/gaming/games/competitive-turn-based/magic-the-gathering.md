# Magic: The Gathering

My first experience was 'that complex card game that older kids played' when I
was very young.
Faintly remember that I specifically thought the lands were really cool, have
specific memory of the plains.
Started playing first from a friend's cube (a collection of cards you can draft
decks from and then play each other in a tournament style).
Was pretty intense/overwhelming at first, but in a good way.
Since have played a bunch on MTG: Arena, a very polished computer interface to
the game.

## Drafting

By far my favorite way to play.

For MTG: Arena, I highly recommend using draftsim.com's "ultimate draft guides"
to learn about new formats, and https://www.17lands.com/ to keep track of
progress.

Try to keep your expectations low to avoid disappointment!

### Draft Moments

#### 10 wins Blue / White Edge of Eternities Quick Draft

Quantum Riddler with some 2 spell synergy.
Thought the deck was not great, but it worked really well.
One mana removal in cryoshatter and focus fire is extremely good.
