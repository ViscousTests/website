## Decks I've Tried

### Jacqueline Fine

Felt like I could do almost everything well, and manipulating tokens in the bag was really fun. 

### William Yorick

Awesome to play 5 asserts on turn 1 with gear up!

### Silas Marsh

Heavy on skills.
Not quite as fun as the other decks; some cards (assets) felt kinda
useless/awkward, and there were some turns I couldn't do much.
