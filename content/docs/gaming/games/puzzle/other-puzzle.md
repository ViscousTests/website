# Puzzle Games

Games where the defining characteristic is pondering a solvable game state for a
while.
Each state should be strongly scoped and not evolve over a long time (like a
strategy game).

## Bananagrams

One fun variant is to open a book in text format with some program that can
search text and make it so that you can only use words that exist in that book.

Check out https://old.azlen.me/projects/bananagram_variations/ for other cool
variations!

For a game with more players, this variation might be interesting to try:

To make hard varients easier, you can play with a "wildcard rule".
With this rule, you are allowed to flip over one of your tiles and treat it as a
wildcard letter.
You can choose to switch out which tile is flipped at any time.
