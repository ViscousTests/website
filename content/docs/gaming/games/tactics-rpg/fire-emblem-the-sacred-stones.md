(And Fire Emblem 7, the Blazing Blade.)

I first played FE7 game on the Game Boy Advance when I was in middle school.
For some reason the art style and especially animation really spoke to me, and I
found the gameplay loop very compelling.
Fair warning though that this game may be on this list mostly because of
nostalgia.
One aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building your
party over time and making sure you train the right characters.
It's very satisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience
with the goal of making them a core part of your team composition later on.
This is often fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all -
which only adds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.
Another cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters.
When two characters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship,
which leads to little dialogue bites.
It's satisfying to discover these as you play through the game.Both training
weaker units and building supports are examples of 'meta-challenges' in FE; they
aren't required to finish the games, but give you self-directed and sometimes
difficult optional objectives during the battles.Because these challenges are
self directed they make me feel like I am expressing myself more as a player,
which makes the game feel more interesting than if I was just solving the same
battle puzzles as everyone else.
