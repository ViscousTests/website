# Tactics RPG

Games where you grow characters over time, with the gameplay consisting mostly
of difficult tactical battles.

## Iratus: Lord of the Dead

I get the feeling that this game is trying too hard.
It (IMO) has too many mechanics and stats that don't seem to be that
consequential.
There's also a lot to manage; a lot of small decisions need to be made that
don't seem to really individually matter that much.
It's as if the developers were constantly focused on adding more content to the
game and not on the impact/consequence of that content to the strategy the
player develops as they play.

There's also issues where some mechanics are poorly explained.
For example, in combat when you want to stress out the enemies to defeat them
it's unclear what the chances that an enemy will die once they're at zero stress
are.
This makes it impossible to make an informed, tactical decision.

Overall my experience made me wonder if this game is focusing on the tactical
combat or if it's just throwing a bunch of things in and relying on the
spectacle and all the little micro decisions to keep players engaged.
