Really well designed game with a good story, deep character customization, and
difficult encounters.
This game does a great job of letting you customize your character abilities
with a lot of depth, but still with enough constraints to not make every
character feel the same.
Then, it makes the encounters in the main story difficult, but allows you to
level up your characters in 'patrol' side-encounters in case the way you built
your characters was not optimal for the main story.
This is an awesome way to reward players who do a good job with their builds
(they have to grind less) without forcing players into said optimal builds.
