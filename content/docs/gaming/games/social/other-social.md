About guessing other's intent.

# Wavelength or [Longwave](https://longwave.web.app/)

An icebreaker-type game that revolves around guessing people's opinions.

## [Codenames](https://codenames.game/)

One variant worth trying is trying to play with pictures instead of words on the
main board.
A stand-alone game (Codenames Pictures) exists for this, but it's also fun to
try using custom pictures.
For instance, the dream cards from Mysterium led to a pretty fun game.
Note that [this site](https://codenames-pictures.dport.me/) looks like it allows
you to do this in a virtual setting.
