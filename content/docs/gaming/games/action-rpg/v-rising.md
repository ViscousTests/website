Built a neat forest base very open to the trees outside.

Wholesome interactions with a random guy who showed me their cool base.

Stopped playing as server started dying and I saw many amazing bases decaying.
Very bittersweet "all good things must come to an end" vibes.

Brutal difficulty, playing with a friend.
Was really fun, and found some cool people to duel with!

Server died unexpectedly one day, killing our progress.
Serves me right for not finding/joining the discord.
