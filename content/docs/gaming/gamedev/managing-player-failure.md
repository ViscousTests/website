# Managing player failure in games

## Quick saving and quick loading is a bad system

If you as a designer want your player to explore your game without fear, one way
to do it is to implement quick saving and quick loading and recommend that your
player quick save before they do something risky and then quick load if it
doesn't work out.
This is a bad system because it's easy for the player to forget to quick save or
have saved a long time ago then, do something that leads them to failure and
having to reload a long time ago in order to progress in the game.
Also a lot of games have long loading times and quick saving/loading can lead to
frustrating waiting.
If you think you need quicksaving and quick loading in your game, I recommend
looking into games like
[Iron Danger]({{< relref "/docs/gaming/games/tactics-rpg/iron-danger.md" >}})
that have a time rewind mechanic which serves the same purpose but is a lot
more ergonomic for the player to work with.

A very silly and IMO bad quick loading and quicksaving system in a game series
is the system in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun.
In this game, you are literally reminded you to quick save on a regular timer.
You would think that the game would be able to handle that for the player if
that's really the way the designers want you to progress through those games.
I think a time rewinding mechanic in these games would be miles better.
