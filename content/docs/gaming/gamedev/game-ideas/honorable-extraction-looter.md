# Honorable Extraction Looter

One aspect of Dark and Darker that sometimes bothers me is how important the
element of surprise is to winning fights.
This can make the game feel unnecessarily stressful to play, as an instant death
with little warning could be lurking around every corner.

This experience got me thinking of a game concept that could get around this problem.  

My concept is a 2D top down dungeon crawler (like Zero Sievert), but with
instanced combat (where combat occurs in a separate screen from the main map
view, like Pokemon).
Players run around the map and gather resources/fight monsters as per usual.
Players cannot directly fight each other unless one challenges another 
and they accept.

To incentivize fights, players can temporarily "claim"
resources/monsters/bosses.
If another player also claims them and the other doesn't relinquish, they fight.
This would keep the competition for sought after resources alive in the game.
