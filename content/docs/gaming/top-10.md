# My Top 10 Favorite (Video) Games

Currently this list does not have a strict order.

## [Fire Emblem 7 & 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Emblem_(video_game))

I first played this game on the Game Boy Advance when I was in middle school.
For some reason the art style and especially animation really spoke to me, and
I found the gameplay loop very compelling.  Fair warning though that this game
may be on this list mostly because of nostalgia.

One aspect of this game that I really enjoy is the process of building your
party over time and making sure you train the right characters.  It's very
satisfying to help a weaker character finish enemies to get experience with the
goal of making them a core part of your team composition later on.  This is
often fairly difficult - since the characters are weaker after all - which only
adds to the satisfaction when you pull it off.

Another cool mechanic in FE is building supports between characters.  When two
characters fight side by side they will over time build a relationship, which
leads to little dialogue bites.  It's satisfying to discover these as you play
through the game.

Both training weaker units and building supports are examples of
"meta-challenges" in FE; they aren't required to finish the games, but give you
self-directed and sometimes difficult optional objectives during the battles.
Because these challenges are self directed they make me feel like I am
expressing myself more as a player, which makes the game feel more interesting
than if I was just solving the same battle puzzles as everyone else.
