# Buying PC Games

## [isthereanydeal](https://isthereanydeal.com/)

Store aggregation site where you can search for the best game prices across
many stores.  Haven't used it much yet, but I plan to!

## Steam

Has good sales and an amazing UI/management system for your game collection.
Even if you don't buy on Steam, I recommend buying somewhere that gives
Steam-redeemable game keys so you can use the management interface Steam
provides.

## Epic Games Store

Every Thursday this store gives away a couple free games, that are often quite
good.  Worth checking in on Thursday just to redeem this offer.

## Key Resellers

These sites generally have the cheapest prices for games, but are morally
questionable. I think many of their games are purchased with stolen credit
cards and resold as a way to get money out of said credit cards.
