# Monitor Notes

In October 2023 I decided to finally test out some high refresh rate monitors
(more than the 60 Hz I was using).
I tried three and definitely noticed the higher refresh rate even when moving
the mouse on windows desktop.
In games I noticed it as well.
I noticed it the most in R6: Siege, probably because my graphics card (GTX 1060)
could get up to 90 FPS in that game.
This differerence was very significant.
I couldn't notice the difference in Valorant or CS 2 as much.

 - A [1080p 24" VA 165 Hz one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QW2G35J?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
   - This one was very smooth (I could get higher FPS with 1080p), but the drop
     in resolution was too strong to ignore.
     Also the colors were not great compared to my other IPS 1440p 60Hz.
 - A [1440p 27" VA 144Hz curved one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGQCKWSM?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
   - The viewing angle of this curved monitor was real bad, making the
     brightness/colors change a lot based on how I looked at it.
     This + the color difference was very noticible.
     Specifically it was ard to get the same level of sharpness as my other
     monitor for text.
 - A [1440p 27" IPS 165Hz one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRP5F2SB?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)
   - This monitor was the best one I tried.
     But still the sharpness/colors were worse than my other monitor.

In the end I decided to return everything.
In the future if I get a better graphics card that lets me get >100 FPS at 1440p
on most games I'll probably upgrate my monitor too.
