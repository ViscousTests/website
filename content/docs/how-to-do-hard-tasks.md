# How to Do Hard Tasks

## What Makes Tasks Hard?

Tasks are hard when you don't already have pathways in your brain that script
them, or your existing pathways are incomplete.  Doing hard tasks requires
learning.

One way to model a task is as a tree of possibilities, where each node is a
decision with any number of possible outcomes.  With this model, tasks can be
seen as difficult for multiple reasons:

### Complexity

Tasks are **complex** with they contain many potential decision points which in
turn reveal many others.

### Committing

Committing tasks include decisions that are costly to reverse (or
cannot be reversed).

### Opaque

Opaque tasks contain many hidden decision points, or decision points that take
effort to discover.


## What Makes Tasks Easy?

Tasks are easy when a pathway has already been constructed in your head to
execute that task effectively (traverse the tree of decisions in a
predetermined way).

It's good to be cautious of tasks that you find to be easy.  In my experience
it's a human tendency to strongly defend the solutions to the tasks that one
holds (see [a reddit post about political
beliefs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/iu865f/oc_i_did_some_presidential_economic_statistics_to/g5k93df/)
and Claire's old lab's observation that ideas/theories can become "precious"
once created).  This makes sense, since it takes effort/time/resources to
create a task-solving pathway.  See also David Eagleman's neuroscience books,
which talk about this.  However, this strong defense can blind one to obvious
flaws or much better pathways.  It's probably a good habit to re-learn from
scratch hard tasks that are important to do well.


## Hard Task Solving Strategies - How to Learn

Learning requires active exploration of the real world task tree for the task
you want to learn to do.  Through this exploration, the tree is transcribed
from the real world into mental pathways.  So one way to think about learning
hard tasks is learning how to most efficiently explore/transcribe the task
tree.


### Questions

Some parts of the task tree may already exist in your brain from another task
you've done - for example, most of the muscle movement mental pathways needed
to run already exist in someone who knows how to walk.  Other parts may be
completely new, or even contradictory to existing mental pathways.  A very
efficient way to more quickly learn these alien pathways is to question them
via:

 - Asking a task expert
 - Asking a reference (e.g. A book or Google search)
 - Tinkering with the task space (e.g. Attempting to run some computer code)


### Environmental Influence

The human brain constantly absorbs new information from its perspective on the
environment where it is.
For learning therefore, it can be helpful to place oneself in an environment
conducive to learning what you want to learn.  This usually makes it more
obvious what questions to ask to further map out the task space.

### Depth First Search of Task Tree

Perhaps a preference of iNtuitive Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to
fast good solutions, but also blindness to obvious other paths.

### Breath First Search of Task Tree

Perhaps a habit of Sensing Myers-Briggs personalities, this can lead to good
scoping of the task space, but may exhaust energy to "go deep" on a specific
task solution.

I think this is what Nassim Taleb advocates for doing more in complex task
space.  He writes that exposing oneself to many decision points and giving
oneself the option to travel will long term find one the most success.


## Mental Perspective

The brain only understands the world as it perceives it through the senses.
Although the senses can take in a high volume of information, there is still
heavy processing that must be done for this information to be useful/actionable
by the rest of the brain.  There are many points along this chain of processing
where learned perspective shapes what the rest of the brain sees.  For instance,
an image of an engine may just look like metal to an untrained brain, but tells
a very different story to a mechanic.  

In a way, learning or training is just the process of acquiring new perspectives
from which to see the world.  This explains why learning can be such a "stop and
go" process - it's easy to be stuck on a concept for a while before it finally
clicks.

  - Imagining how to avoid failure is often more useful than imagining how to
    succeed.

### The Chase

Having a set of clear objectives that are each quick, but demanding to achieve
is a good way to enter flow.


## "Intelligence"

Informed by:
 - WASL/SAT/GRE tests I've taken
 - https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/g-miseducation-larry-p

In my opinion, intelligence as a concept is a harmful oversimplification.  My
thoughts on several contexts in which the word is used are described here:

### Ability to Learn


Tests judging intelligence, or general mental ability, are used to decide
whether students at all levels are capable of participating in certain
educational activities.  
These activities include taking certain courses and being admitted into certain
programs or schools.


### Social Perception

People use intelligence to describe each other in a general way.
