# Recommended Non-Fiction Reads

## [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

Refreshing read that shows that building good habits and systems in your life
is much more effective and doable than using raw willpower to get achieve
goals.

## [Paul Graham's Blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)

Cool insights about investing, technology, and life.


## [Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PLD7E21BF91F3F9683)

Cool lecture series, not done yet!


## Books by David Eagleman

Incognito, Livewired, The Brain: The Story of You.  All great pop-neuroscience
reads!  Incognito especially left a big impression of me when I read it as a
freshman in college.


## [How to Change your Mind by Michael Pollan](https://michaelpollan.com/books/how-to-change-your-mind/)

Interesting history of psychedelics in the USA, with some particularly
insightful ideas about how the brain is organized (and works) in the last few
chapters.


## [Antifragile by Nassim Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)

Really insightful book into types of systems in the world and how they behave.
Specifically those that manifest "antifragile" behaviors.

### What is Antifragility?

Fragile - hurt by random variation
Robust - not sensitive to anything
Antifraile - hurt by lack of variation


### Convexity/Concavity

The fragile is well represented by a concave distribution - outcomes are fine
most of the time, but can sometimes be catastrophic.

The antifragile is well represented by a convex distribution - outcomes are
fine most of the time, but can sometimes be very good.


### Theorizing vs Tinkering

Theorizing involves making many (tested or untested) logical steps to explain a
behavior.  This is most effective in simple systems with little
self-interaction (e.g. toy physics models).  When applied to complex systems,
theorizing can be fragile.

Random tinkering is done by making immediate decisions (hopefully with multiple
options) in a more near-sighted way.  The results of these decisions feed back
into the process, hopefully stumbling the tinkerer closer to a solution.  This
is antifragile - your expectations are low most of the time, but sometimes you
stumble onto something very groundbreaking.
