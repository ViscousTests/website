# Motivation

NOTE This is a random theory of mine; don't put too much stock into it!

Motivation to do something requires that the "something" is **attainable**
and **meaningful** (has a point/purpose).  

## (Perceived) Attainability

Objectives that are *perceived* - which is really all that matters with respect
to motivation - to be attainable have a trivially easy to accomplish next step
on the path toward them.  

What makes a next step trivially easy?  If your body/mind are primed to do the
task such that you could do it with minimal/no conscious intervention.  For
example walking, reading, or doing some trained skill are trivially easy.  Note
that this depends on the current state of your body; walking may not be
trivially easy if you are exhausted or have a broken leg.  And also the state
of your mind; responding to a conversation may be hard if you haven't caught up
on what has been said.

Note that the whole path to the objective does not have to be trivially easy or
even known.  All that matters where motivation is concerned is the next step
(at least for attainability).

Motivation can flag when the next step towards a goal is unclear.  In such
situations it's easy to simply switch gears to another activity which has clear
steps - this is procrastination.

### How to make things attainable

When something feels unattainable because either (a) it seems so hard you would
fail if you tried or (b) its unclear what step to take next, I have found
several tricks that work pretty well:

**The first trick** is to take a step back both from the problem at hand AND
from anything else that engages your mind.  The goal here is to put yourself in
a state of boredom, then slightly nudge your thoughts toward your issue.  Often
I find my mind much more eagerly thinks about something when the prospect of
boredom is there as an alternative.  One way to do this is by going and sitting
in another chair far from distractions.  

Another alternative is going for a walk or run, preferably with no audio or
other distractions.  This method also usually engages my creativity, which
helps open up new potential paths to issue resolution.  There is the drawback
that sometimes here my creativity will wander, and I will end up with good
ideas about something other than my issue.

**The second trick** is to talk to someone about the issue.  Sometimes the act
of putting your issue into works can snap some clarity into it.  The person
your are talking to may also offer useful insights.  Writing thoughts down can
also sometimes work here, if no-one is available to talk to.

**The third trick** only applies when you find the task hard, but you see the
path you would take to do it.  In this case, for me listening to energetic
music or putting myself in an energetic, stimulating, or even stressful
environment (e.g. with other people around) can help me feel more active and
therefore more able to do my hard task.  I think part of this is that the
stimulation occupies the higher level part of my mind that's telling me the
task is hard, and just lets the less conscious parts of me simply execute.
Again, this only works for a case (a) above, **not** when it's unclear what to
do next.  See the book "Antifragile" for more on this, specifically Book 1
Chapter 2.

### How to make things LESS attainable

When stuck on attainability, there are several counterproductive strategies:

**Eating food** in hopes that it will give you energy to push through.  This
always just makes me MORE tired especially in the short term.  Plus I usually
feel more able/energetic when I am slightly hungry.

**Trying to brute force** your way through an issue without trying alternate
routes.  This sometimes works, but usually just makes me feel stupid and can
lead to a vicious cycle where I continually burn more and more energy in less
and less well directed ways trying to prove I am not stupid :).  The key to
avoiding this is making sure you aren't following the same lines of thought
over and over, and stopping if you find yourself doing so.

The tendency to try to brute force I find is more and more temping the most
tired you are.  One way to explain this is that as you do something hard (that
you don't already have mental circuits to handle) , your mind contracts/focuses
on the problem until it becomes so rigid that even the slightest unexpected
event (or new solution idea) is hard to handle.  This is counter to an
"expanded" mind where many possibilities are open and easy to handle.  If you
have been focusing hard on one thing, a way to expand your mind is to do
something you might find boring and let your mind wander its way to expansion.
As discussed earlier, going for a walk or otherwise exercising I find hastens
this process.  So going for a walk with no stimulation (no reading on phone, no
listening to anything, no conversations with people) is a great technique.
Some of this is inspired by the last part of Chapter 5 of "How to Change Your
Mind" by Michael Pollan.


## (Perceived) Meaning

Activities are meaningful when they fit neatly into a larger narrative.  This
could be a grand narrative about one's identity (e.g. defined by what [virtues
you aspire to or possess](https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths)),
or a myopic narrative about what puzzle piece should fit next into the puzzle
to bring it closer to solution.

What you or others may find meaningful in a certain situation varies a lot for
many reasons.  I have found myself obsessed with completing certain goals, and
then having my obsession and motivation completely evaporate after reframing
the larger context those goals fit into.  

One way to lose motivation for a task is to follow the meaning of the task up
through all the ways it impacts the world, coming to the final conclusion that
there is no greater meaning in the world (or you don't know what it is), and
therefore the task itself is meaningless.  This kind of "bubbling up" can
happen on a smaller scale as well.
