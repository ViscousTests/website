# Welcome!

This is a place where I store useful thoughts and memories.  Hopefully you find
it as useful as I do!

Contrary to a periodic blog, I try to actively update and revise these pages,
keeping them as living documents as I learn. I partially see this as a [mind
map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) - see [Mind Mapping Concept]({{< relref
"/docs/thought-experiments/mind-mapping-concept.md" >}}) for more details. 

I also try to follow this advice on my [Writing]({{< relref
"/docs/lifestyle-optimizations/writing.md" >}}) page.

{{% include "/content/docs/all.edn" %}}
{{< /random_page >}}

{{< website_graph >}}

Double click on nodes to go to the pages the represent!

Nodes with bold text and a purple background are "recent" - a tag I use to
denote something as important or recently relevant to let it stand out from
everything else.
