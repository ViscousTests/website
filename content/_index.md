# Welcome!

This is a place where I store useful thoughts and memories.  Hopefully you find
it as useful as I do!

Contrary to a periodic blog, I try to actively update and revise these pages,
keeping them as living documents as I learn.

I also try to follow this advice:

TODO: Put a graph visualization of the website here like
https://beepb00p.xyz/blog-graph.html or using the same code from my
<a href="/reddit-tree.html">Reddit comment tree project</a>.
